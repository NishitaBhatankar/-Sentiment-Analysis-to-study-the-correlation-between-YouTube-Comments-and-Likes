Also the trainstations use the name depending of their region, so everything will be in french in wallonia, but once the train will reach a dutch city the name will be in dutch so you could believe you aren&#39;t at the good place and stay in the train, you won&#39;t be noticed when you cross the regions and if you don&#39;t be carefull you could believe you are in a different country in 10 minutes, that&#39;s totaly normal in Belgium. Be careful because most tourist I meet are lost or struggle to find some places. Also most people doesn&#39;t speak both languages, so I suggest to use english if you can. I would also add that the country is very windy, and the wind comes from the north, so when it&#39;s 20°C outside it&#39;s like 15°C. Only 2 or 3 month at summer are sunny and tolerable, the rest of the yeat it&#39;s rainy and cold. You could also struggle to find a public bathroom, according to the law each city must have toilet, but they are often very well hidden, broken, or dirty, so go to the toilet at the trainstations or in a shop/coffee. The Ardenens are nice but be carefull with bikes, because it&#39;s never flat, if you are bad a sport it won&#39;t be cool for you. The bus are often kind of random when you leave a big city, the could be very late, I personnaly don&#39;t trust them as a citizen when I have a meeting. The trains are often late and you can easily miss your correspondence, they are also overcrowed, especially during friday and sunday. Overcrowed means it&#39;s impossible to sit. You can also visit Walibi Belgium if you like RollerCoasters, or Pairi Daiza if you like animals, it&#39;s a super nice theme park, but it&#39;s only good during summer, I suggest to visit the caves when it&#39;s cold outside, it&#39;s less overcrowded and the temperature is always the same underground.', '<a href=\"https://youtu.be/6v1H1EGXxrA\">https://youtu.be/6v1H1EGXxrA</a>', 'Great video about the beautiful country.

Le Suisse n&#39; a pas l&#39;habitude de donner du bakchich à\\xa0 son administration parfaite d&#39;ailleurs et qui lui envoie ses papiers jusqu&#39;à chez lui! <br><br>L&#39;ambassade quand il contraire le Suisse et lui parle de règles et lois, ses fonctionnaires s&#39;attendent à\\xa0 ce que le Demandeur Suisse ou marocains lui donne un gros bakchic sinon ils n&#39;auront pas leur papiers d&#39;investissement comme ils le veulent... <br><br>Étant d&#39;origine Marocaines, une fois j&#39; avais fait les démarches pour mon passeport marocain,\\xa0 quand j&#39;ai payé, le fonctionnaire m&#39;a dit qu&#39;il n&#39;a pas la monnaie pour que je lui laisse le reste. Comme au Maroc, c&#39;est une astuce car il a la monnaie. <br><br>En plus il faut aller\\xa0 chercher le passeport une fois prêt, il n&#39;a y a que les marocains qui corrompent L&#39;ambassade qui reçoivent leur passeports chez eux et c&#39;est un fonctionnaire qui les leur amène chez eux. <br><br>Depuis je n&#39;ai plus renouvelé mon passeport marocain. Étant naturalisée je voyage avec mon passeport Suisse que je reçois chez moi comme tous les Suisses.\\xa0 Et pour une autre raison c&#39;est que L&#39;ambassade du Maroc se trouve à Berne en Suisse côté alémanique, très\\xa0 loin de Lausanne où j&#39;habites, L&#39;ambassade ne répond pas souvent et vous avez le risque d&#39;aller sans téléphoner pour la trouver fermée, fête nationale ou autres... <br><br>Pour ce qui est du consulat marocain à\\xa0 Genève qui est pas loin comme L&#39;ambassade. Je ne sais pas à\\xa0 quoi sert ce consulat qui ne livre ni passeports ni carte d&#39;identitée... <br><br>J&#39;ai eu le malheur de faire appel à leurs service, une incompétence et malhonnêteté incomparables ! J&#39;étais prise en otage par un hôtel 5* à Marrakech au Maroc, le Kenzi Rose Garden ancien Kenzi Farah. <br><br>- veuillez lire les délais dessous- Et j&#39;ai contaté\\xa0 L&#39;ambassade et le consulat pour qu&#39;ils transmettent mon dossier aux autorités Marocaines vu que le ministère du tourisme ne répondait pas ni aucun ministère personne au Maroc ne m&#39;a répondu. <br><br>L&#39;ambassade n&#39;a rien fait, j&#39;ai attendu une année avant de la relancer j&#39;étais en colère, au lieu de répondre par e-mail, pour ne pas laisser de traces, un fonctionnaire m&#39; a téléphoné pour me dire non, alors je lui ai envoyé un email et à\\xa0 plusieurs administrations en laissant les adresses emails visibles ...C&#39;était gênant j&#39;ai écris que L&#39;ambassade m&#39;a téléphoné et a refusé de transmettre mon dossier par téléphone. <br><br>Suite à cet envoi d&#39;email, j&#39;ai reçu un appel de L&#39;ambassade, mais je n&#39;ai pas répondu. Je n&#39;avais plus confiance. <br><br>Et j&#39;ai publié\\xa0 partout que L&#39;ambassade a refusé de transmettre mon dossier au Maroc, et que j&#39;ai encore recu un deuxième appel, qui sert à\\xa0 rien! <br><br>L&#39;ambassade avait le dossier de\\xa0 l&#39;incident complet et que ma vie ainsi que la vie de m&#39;a famille est en danger, car le gérant des hôtels kenzi a menacé ma famille\\xa0 au Maroc en envoyant deux personnes à\\xa0 leur domicile, j&#39;ai l&#39;email que j&#39;ai envoyé à\\xa0 ce gérant, ses hommes ont été vu par des témoins et la résidence de ma famille est équipée de caméras. <br><br>Ce gérant n&#39;est autre que Monsieur Abdellatif Khabbaj, ancien conseiller de Sa Majesté le Roi du Maroc, président de la confédération nationale du tourismse jusqu&#39;à cet été.

            "L&#39;ambassade du Maroc en Suisse doit être contrôlée pour voir la qualité de ses services et de ceux qu&#39;elle ne rendent pas aux marocains résidents en Suisse qui ferment les yeux et ont intérêt à  obtenir leur passeports et cartes d&#39;identité sans problèmes. <br><br>L&#39;ambassade Suisse sert les intérêts de ses citoyens e Suisse, investit beaucoup d&#39;énergie et de savoir faire pour faciliter les démarches et pour les Suisses et pour les investisseurs marocains qui désirent investir en Suisse. <br><br>Mais L&#39;ambassade Marocaine ne fait pas pareil pour les investisseurs Suisses, leur complique les démarches, j&#39;étais surprise d&#39;écouter un investisseur Suisse de Genève me raconter son mécontentement vis à  vis de cette ambassade. <br><br>Mais les Suisse investisseurs au Maroc se plaignent des démarches de ces fonctionnaires marocains sur le sol Suisse  qui ne font rien pour les  faciliter. Le Suisse n&#39; a pas l&#39;habitude de donner du bakchich à  son administration parfaite d&#39;ailleurs et qui lui envoie ses papiers jusqu&#39;à chez lui! <br><br>L&#39;ambassade quand il contraire le Suisse et lui parle de règles et lois, ses fonctionnaires s&#39;attendent à  ce que le Demandeur Suisse ou marocains lui donne un gros bakchic sinon ils n&#39;auront pas leur papiers d&#39;investissement comme ils le veulent... <br><br>Étant d&#39;origine Marocaines, une fois j&#39; avais fait les démarches pour mon passeport marocain,  quand j&#39;ai payé, le fonctionnaire m&#39;a dit qu&#39;il n&#39;a pas la monnaie pour que je lui laisse le reste. Comme au Maroc, c&#39;est une astuce car il a la monnaie. <br><br>En plus il faut aller  chercher le passeport une fois prêt, il n&#39;a y a que les marocains qui corrompent L&#39;ambassade qui reçoivent leur passeports chez eux et c&#39;est un fonctionnaire qui les leur amène chez eux. <br><br>Depuis je n&#39;ai plus renouvelé mon passeport marocain. Étant naturalisée je voyage avec mon passeport Suisse que je reçois chez moi comme tous les Suisses.  Et pour une autre raison c&#39;est que L&#39;ambassade du Maroc se trouve à Berne en Suisse côté alémanique, très  loin de Lausanne où j&#39;habites, L&#39;ambassade ne répond pas souvent et vous avez le risque d&#39;aller sans téléphoner pour la trouver fermée, fête nationale ou autres... <br><br>Pour ce qui est du consulat marocain à  Genève qui est pas loin comme L&#39;ambassade. Je ne sais pas à  quoi sert ce consulat qui ne livre ni passeports ni carte d&#39;identitée... <br><br>J&#39;ai eu le malheur de faire appel à leurs service, une incompétence et malhonnêteté incomparables ! J&#39;étais prise en otage par un hôtel 5* à Marrakech au Maroc, le Kenzi Rose Garden ancien Kenzi Farah. <br><br>- veuillez lire les délais dessous- Et j&#39;ai contaté  L&#39;ambassade et le consulat pour qu&#39;ils transmettent mon dossier aux autorités Marocaines vu que le ministère du tourisme ne répondait pas ni aucun ministère personne au Maroc ne m&#39;a répondu. <br><br>L&#39;ambassade n&#39;a rien fait, j&#39;ai attendu une année avant de la relancer j&#39;étais en colère, au lieu de répondre par e-mail, pour ne pas laisser de traces, un fonctionnaire m&#39; a téléphoné pour me dire non, alors je lui ai envoyé un email et à  plusieurs administrations en laissant les adresses emails visibles ...C&#39;était gênant j&#39;ai écris que L&#39;ambassade m&#39;a téléphoné et a refusé de transmettre mon dossier par téléphone. <br><br>Suite à cet envoi d&#39;email, j&#39;ai reçu un appel de L&#39;ambassade, mais je n&#39;ai pas répondu. Je n&#39;avais plus confiance. <br><br>Et j&#39;ai publié  partout que L&#39;ambassade a refusé de transmettre mon dossier au Maroc, et que j&#39;ai encore recu un deuxième appel, qui sert à  rien! <br><br>L&#39;ambassade avait le dossier de  l&#39;incident complet et que ma vie ainsi que la vie de m&#39;a famille est en danger, car le gérant des hôtels kenzi a menacé ma famille  au Maroc en envoyant deux personnes à  leur domicile, j&#39;ai l&#39;email que j&#39;ai envoyé à  ce gérant, ses hommes ont été vu par des témoins et la résidence de ma famille est équipée de caméras. <br><br>Ce gérant n&#39;est autre que Monsieur Abdellatif Khabbaj, ancien conseiller de Sa Majesté le Roi du Maroc, président de la confédération nationale du tourismse jusqu&#39;à cet été. Un abus de pouvoir! <br><br>À  quoi nous sert une telle ambassade ? <br><br>Comment investir au Maroc alors que la sécurité n&#39;y est plus. Et ce sont les privés&amp;Fonctionnaires qui nuisent à  son économie... <br><br>Sur TripAdvisoron mon commentaire sur l&#39;hôtel, initulé &quot; ABUS&amp;MENACES&amp;PRISE D&#39;OTAGE PAR L&#39;HÔTEL&quot; Février 2020.

If for the sake of the honeymoon it is not suitable, then I will rate nature tourism in Indonesia 10/10. In my opinion, it is very suitable for tourists who have an adventurous spirit in the wild. This is why Indonesian tourism is still underestimated by most foreign tourists because its natural attractions are very beautiful but also deadly. <br><br>My personal opinion after visiting several countries :<br>&gt;Maldives (Very suitable as a honeymoon place, the sea is calm and beautiful).<br>&gt;Thailand (Culinary tourism because Thai food is world famous).<br>&gt;Indonesia (Nature tourism because it has a very different level, but be careful when going there because the nature is a bit unfriendly unpredictable but very satisfying and amazing).<br>&gt;Philippines (It&#39;s very easy to communicate with local people and there can also see a variety of entertainment and 7.600 islands WOW).<br>&gt;France (The country most visited by foreign tourists is number 1 in the world, because there are place names that are already known to the world, this is no joke).<br>&gt;India (My favorite place is foot massage service and the uniqueness of people in India in terms of selling or doing activities). <br><br>When I visited Indonesia, there were natural attractions that made me speechless and many natural attractions that didn&#39;t make sense. Even the place was hidden from the settlement.

            "My trip while in Indonesia was very satisfying and at the same time scared me (natural disasters), I personally think Indonesia is a place of adventure and exploration. If for the sake of the honeymoon it is not suitable, then I will rate nature tourism in Indonesia 10/10. In my opinion, it is very suitable for tourists who have an adventurous spirit in the wild. This is why Indonesian tourism is still underestimated by most foreign tourists because its natural attractions are very beautiful but also deadly. <br><br>My personal opinion after visiting several countries :<br>&gt;Maldives (Very suitable as a honeymoon place, the sea is calm and beautiful).<br>&gt;Thailand (Culinary tourism because Thai food is world famous).<br>&gt;Indonesia (Nature tourism because it has a very different level, but be careful when going there because the nature is a bit unfriendly unpredictable but very satisfying and amazing).<br>&gt;Philippines (It&#39;s very easy to communicate with local people and there can also see a variety of entertainment and 7.600 islands WOW).<br>&gt;France (The country most visited by foreign tourists is number 1 in the world, because there are place names that are already known to the world, this is no joke).<br>&gt;India (My favorite place is foot massage service and the uniqueness of people in India in terms of selling or doing activities). <br><br>When I visited Indonesia, there were natural attractions that made me speechless and many natural attractions that didn&#39;t make sense. Even the place was hidden from the settlement. Nature tourism in Indonesia is like a woman who is very beautiful, unique and strange, but also very deadly because she often goes on a rampage.\n",

If you don&#39;t have many days, make sure to spend some time in Skukuza (Most history, restaurants as well as sleeping in a hotel in a train on the train bridge while you can watch all the animals).<br><br>2) Cape Town, Definitely visit Table Mountain, The market place plaza, Ford of Good Hope &amp; the beaches. A lot of history. To expand you can go on a boat out on Camps Bay to Seal island or from centre to Robben Island. Also options to expand to the winelands that are close by just out the city.<br><br>3) Wine Route, All between the Langeberg mountains, Swellendam, Worcester, Robertson, Montagu, Touwsrivier,  Franschoek, Stellenbosch, many many wine farms.<br><br>4) Drakensberg - Highest peak in SA, would definitely recommend either just after the rainy season is summer when it&#39;s very green, lush and BEAUTIFUL (might be hot) or in mid July when it&#39;s snowing (very beautiful).<br><br>5) Northern Kwa-Zulu Natal,  They mention the Hluhluwe game reserve (with a wrong pronunciation lol), but there&#39;s many more! Go visit St. Lucia, a beautiful town, an hour away from the Hluhluwe-Imfolozi game reserve, where you can see your big 5 animals. Also even in winter the beaches of the town are warm due to the Indian ocean. The town is also surrounded by the Isimangaliso game reserve, an estuary where the river floats into the ocean. You will truly be at peace with nature and it&#39;s much more quiet than Kruger National Park + variety. Can also extend with many game reserves even north, elephant interactions or traveling on a boat out on the river to see hippos and crocs. Don&#39;t forget Scuba-diving at the world&#39;s famous Sodwana Bay just north!<br><br>6) Johannesburg / Pretoria, Though not as WILD as many places above, the Gauteng province has all the luxury, casino&#39;s, malls, hotels and all you need. Also much history, museums and monuments. Gauteng is also very close to major destinations just outside the city (Sun City / Parys / Bela Bela / Hartbeespoort).<br><br>7) Durban, Centre Kwa-Zulu Natal, Durban is the city that never sleeps. Always sunny, beautiful beaches and don&#39;t let me start on water parks or aquariums. Tons to due in the city and if you ever want a bit of peace and quiet extend to northern KZN.<br><br>8) South Coast (Hermanus, Mossel Bay, George, Kysna, Plettenberg Bay) All dream peaceful locations with beautiful green scenery, forests, mountains and beaches. Whale watching? Hermanus. Best Beaches, Mossel Bay area. Biggest &quot;city&quot; &amp; shops, George. Most forests / hiking / camping all from Knysna to Plett.<br><br>9) Northern Cape - Not so popular with first time visitors as you&#39;re heading into the dessert of SA, but there are some beautiful scenery just need to travel quite a distance. Sutherland, Massive telescopes where you can watch the stars and planets at night. Kimberley, Kimberley&#39;s hole, mine &amp; museum. Namaqualand. beautiful beautiful flowers in the desert once a year. <br><br>10) Lowveld (Blyde River Canyon, Mac Mac Falls, God&#39;s Window, Pinacle Rock &amp; so so much more beautiful scenery). Forests, green, nice hiking, close to Kruger National Park. <br><br>11) <b>Special shout out</b> Sun City (Holiday Resort, Golf Estate, Lodges, Pilanesberg national park) View nature in a hot air balloon &amp; sky diving (2 hours away from Gauteng). &amp; Port Elizabeth (Not as popular as the Western Cape &amp; quite isolated), PE has beautiful beaches for a peaceful holiday away from all the buzz of people rushing to the beach. <b>It can get very windy in the Eastern Cape</b>', 'Ya', 'Adding the beauty of the Northern Cape during Namaqualand&#39;s flowering time and the Kgalagadi would have been another plus.', 'I am a proud South African I was kind of dissapointed not to see Sabi here.', 'The ultimate goal for us is to visit all these places in our BUILT OUT CAMPER VAN  that we built during the lockdown, well kitted out to run us around SA, Vanlife in South Africa', 'There is no tourist place  around Johannesburg 😨😨😨', 'planning a trip to visit south africa', 'Nice TY', 'is it bad that im south african and ive been to very few of these places', 'Am I South African?

            "My top 10 for any international tourist: <br><br>1) Kruger National Park. If you don&#39;t have many days, make sure to spend some time in Skukuza (Most history, restaurants as well as sleeping in a hotel in a train on the train bridge while you can watch all the animals).<br><br>2) Cape Town, Definitely visit Table Mountain, The market place plaza, Ford of Good Hope &amp; the beaches. A lot of history. To expand you can go on a boat out on Camps Bay to Seal island or from centre to Robben Island. Also options to expand to the winelands that are close by just out the city.<br><br>3) Wine Route, All between the Langeberg mountains, Swellendam, Worcester, Robertson, Montagu, Touwsrivier,  Franschoek, Stellenbosch, many many wine farms.<br><br>4) Drakensberg - Highest peak in SA, would definitely recommend either just after the rainy season is summer when it&#39;s very green, lush and BEAUTIFUL (might be hot) or in mid July when it&#39;s snowing (very beautiful).<br><br>5) Northern Kwa-Zulu Natal,  They mention the Hluhluwe game reserve (with a wrong pronunciation lol), but there&#39;s many more! Go visit St. Lucia, a beautiful town, an hour away from the Hluhluwe-Imfolozi game reserve, where you can see your big 5 animals. Also even in winter the beaches of the town are warm due to the Indian ocean. The town is also surrounded by the Isimangaliso game reserve, an estuary where the river floats into the ocean. You will truly be at peace with nature and it&#39;s much more quiet than Kruger National Park + variety. Can also extend with many game reserves even north, elephant interactions or traveling on a boat out on the river to see hippos and crocs. Don&#39;t forget Scuba-diving at the world&#39;s famous Sodwana Bay just north!<br><br>6) Johannesburg / Pretoria, Though not as WILD as many places above, the Gauteng province has all the luxury, casino&#39;s, malls, hotels and all you need. Also much history, museums and monuments. Gauteng is also very close to major destinations just outside the city (Sun City / Parys / Bela Bela / Hartbeespoort).<br><br>7) Durban, Centre Kwa-Zulu Natal, Durban is the city that never sleeps. Always sunny, beautiful beaches and don&#39;t let me start on water parks or aquariums. Tons to due in the city and if you ever want a bit of peace and quiet extend to northern KZN.<br><br>8) South Coast (Hermanus, Mossel Bay, George, Kysna, Plettenberg Bay) All dream peaceful locations with beautiful green scenery, forests, mountains and beaches. Whale watching? Hermanus. Best Beaches, Mossel Bay area. Biggest &quot;city&quot; &amp; shops, George. Most forests / hiking / camping all from Knysna to Plett.<br><br>9) Northern Cape - Not so popular with first time visitors as you&#39;re heading into the dessert of SA, but there are some beautiful scenery just need to travel quite a distance. Sutherland, Massive telescopes where you can watch the stars and planets at night. Kimberley, Kimberley&#39;s hole, mine &amp; museum. Namaqualand. beautiful beautiful flowers in the desert once a year. <br><br>10) Lowveld (Blyde River Canyon, Mac Mac Falls, God&#39;s Window, Pinacle Rock &amp; so so much more beautiful scenery). Forests, green, nice hiking, close to Kruger National Park. <br><br>11) <b>Special shout out</b> Sun City (Holiday Resort, Golf Estate, Lodges, Pilanesberg national park) View nature in a hot air balloon &amp; sky diving (2 hours away from Gauteng). &amp; Port Elizabeth (Not as popular as the Western Cape &amp; quite isolated), PE has beautiful beaches for a peaceful holiday away from all the buzz of people rushing to the beach. <b>It can get very windy in the Eastern Cape</b>\n",

I don&#39;t see this as being a negative though, if you can tell people no (when you don&#39;t have the time) and ensure your work is done, then it makes people think your indispensible (that is also a negative, as sometimes it can prevent career development as they don&#39;t want to lose so many skills from that department).\n",

My supervisor told me that the analyst should be the smartest person in the room with the ability to answer all the questions management throws at you.

By the way I noticed that you started a video series, &quot;For your Data Science Project&quot; and I really want you to continue making videos for this particular series because there&#39;s literally no one on YouTube with such guidance on DS projects and I have been looking for one since a very long time because I have my placements just after 12 months and I really want to make a full stack data science project. Thank you.\n",

Few suggestions:  <br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqBFgaMgFQA&amp;t=6m58s\">6:58</a>  It is more clear to use a variable name like &quot;file_name&quot; rather than the more ambiguous variable name &quot;file&quot;<br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqBFgaMgFQA&amp;t=8m31s\">8:31</a>  To improve readability, consider putting each .replace() call on a separate line followed by the escape character.

So for Russia to have the temerity to dope for a sport they have never previously, whilst under the microscope of a country wide Olympic ban looks out of character.<br><br>Seems more so like a clear message that western NATO countries are applying geopolitical pressure on Russia through intermediary channels given the backdrop of failed Ukraine-Russia diplomatic talks.\n",

And watch every athlete eyeball eachother to make sure they are all clean  from then on out\n",
            "Let&#39;s be frank.  We all have known it for years, seeing  suddenly so many Russian skaters started to do so many  impossible jumps without hurting their joints.  But we couldn&#39;t get them because Russians were so skillful in dealing drugs.\n",
            "China&#39;s Sun Yang and Russia&#39;s Nadezhda Sergeeva also tested positive for trimetazidine and swift action was taken to ban and disqualify them. It wouldn&#39;t be fair if she were allowed to compete considering it&#39;s the same banned substance.\n",

Mr. Dodik is not breaking up anything, dear BBC readers, he is decided against the Republic of Srpska joining NATO, while your GB, USA and NATO are forcing remaining Serbian countries in Balkans (we are using the older authentic name for it, &quot;Helm&quot;, instead of Turkish &quot;Balkan&quot;) to join NATO. Since Serbians will rightfully NEVER join the gang that bombarded us with depleted uranium during the &#39;90s, occupied Kosovo and Metochia and then condemned Serbs for the war that the CIA had planned against us long beforehand, GB is trying to reunite Bosnia that they had deliberately divided in the &#39;90s, this time in order to forcefully pull it into NATO, hoping that Croatians and Muslims would ease the process and overvote the Serbs, if the country were united again. Now, whoever knows a bit of history before the said bombardment, would understand that Serbs and Russians belong to the same culture, that Russians have migrated to Russia from the Vinca region, near Belgrade, during the neolithic era, that we had almost 2000 years of common Christian history, language, culture and justice systems stemming from The East Roman Empire, all of which you Westerners gladly disregard, in order to forget the truth of force, robbery and deliberate destruction of this part of the world in order to build your empires and decorate your Museums with stollen artifacts, hailed by the Vatican, Roman Club, Bilderberg, Soros, Rockefellers and the likes.\n",
            "Serbs would happily brag about hundreds of thousands of innocent civillians they killed during the war and how they ethnically cleansed hundreds of Bosnian villages, then get mad when people call it out as genocide 🤦‍♂️ This is what happens when you let Nazis get away with genocide. Since Serbs did not suffer as others did, they are ready to go out at it again.\n",
