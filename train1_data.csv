1,Has anyone picked up ‚ÄúStorytelling With Data: Let‚Äôs Practice‚Äù? I was wondering which one to get or if it‚Äôs worth having both
2,That was the best sponsorship video section i have ever seen. Nice
3,Love all the 5 steps you laid out. I recently had an interview and applied step 4 on the visualization part. <br><br>Can&#39;t thank you enough for this (timely) video! Looking forward to more content like this!
4,"Morning brew asking for lot of unnecessary details on signup, I quit, why do they want to know your postal code, where do you work,for a newsletter? Are they harvesting my information? I‚Äôm not signing up, my condition, email should be enough for newsletter otherwise it‚Äôs suspicious"
5,Wowww
6,Can someone suggest me the best book for python for beginners
7,"Power BI is doing greatüíñ This was a great review, thank you!"
8,"Hey Luke, there‚Äôs another (from the same author) book called ‚ÄúStorytelling with data: let‚Äôs practice‚Äù The author says that it works like a companion guide with the original book ( the one that you mentioned on the video). So I think it‚Äôs a great idea to read both books at the same time."
9,i&#39;m sorry but all the concepts shown in this book are basics...
10,Thank you
11,thanks Luke! What an instructive video!
12,Thanks for the recommendation. I bought the book yesterday morning from Amazon (with your link ;) of course ) and got it the same day. I am about 30 pages in and I am loving it!
13,This is great!
14,"I am currently studying to be a data analyst with no background in data at all. I was recommended this book and I am over halfway through so far. It is absolutely fantastic! It really helped me to organize and rethink the way I think about data which lowered my stress levels as I was overwhelmed with the learning process. I have also bought the companion book, which has excercies, and I will be reading it after I finish the current one."
15,Hey Luke. Awesome video! Can you make a video on how to use data analytics for Crypto markets?
16,Dood-bro lol
17,"Thank you Luke for sharing and telling! This is awesome. You are way much better than some presentors in YouTube. This is simple, clear and clean and on-point. I am interested in buying that book. Ill save some to buy that.üôÇüôÇüôÇ"
18,Five-step approach in communicating with data:<br><br><br>1. understanding the Importance of context: (who you are communicating to what you want your audience to do and how can data help make that point)<br><br>2. Choose an effective visual: (about 80% of the visuals used are either a bar chart or a line chart: you can more easily see their relative values compared to each other and also how they&#39;re trending over time and which one&#39;s on top and which one&#39;s on bottom)<br><br><br>3. Remove Cluttering: () <br><br><br>4.Focus your audience&#39;s attention (size + color)<br><br><br>5. Use words and titles:

20,"Hey Luke, thanks for the content! I‚Äôm a 28 year old vet and I would like to start learning about data analysis to apply it on my field. I‚Äôm thinking on taking a sql course and later one on power bi. Would you recommend anything else? Right know I only use basic excel (tables and pivot tables)"
21,"can other languages like c# (.Net), c++, java or even javascript be used instead of python?"
22,LOL I had to learn microsoft access for my college class
23,"Really interesting video, thanks for this.<br>While my job isn&#39;t in IT I do have a continuing interest and have produced an Access database search tool that my work uses. The tool also used custom VBA functions within the SQL query itself (MS allows you to insert pre-defined VBA functions (that e.g. take in and return values) within the query). Can someone tell me if other SQL editor environments allow something similar, where a custom function in a connected programming language, can be inserted into the query? This really opens up SQL immensely as a tool."
24,"Absolutely amazing, you&#39;re one of the top channels that I visit for information regarding data analytics, keep up the great work Luke!"
25,"Hi Luke, I have a questions, so I&#39;m currently looking for a job I just graduated with my bachelors in Finance &amp; Accounting. I&#39;m looking into the position of Financial Analyst. Should I try to learn SQL, Tableau, Power BI, Excel or Python? Or a combination of all of these? Thanks!"
26,Wow! Nice work towards the end!!üòÄüòÄüòÄüòÄ
27,Round these parts S.Q.L is the preferred enunciation. Also data not data.
28,Only 1/3 of the way through and I have already learned so much. Thank you.
29,I&#39;m just gonna up vote for the Access negativity cause honestly it should be burned to the ground.
30,S-Q-L
31,"Amazing explanation Luke ! :D , happy to see my name appear in the list of your subscribers"
32,"Lol, the IT guys and their servers ..."
33,"I don&#39;t get why you need SQL if you work with data analytics software (Power BI, etc.)? These tools build SQL for you automatically. Been doing Power BI for living for years. Never used a single SQL statement except a few very special cases."
34,"Setting up the feed for splunk or tableau is kind of a one shot deal, then it becomes those technologies you have to learn."
35,"Hey Luke, this is another brilliant piece of content. So easy to follow and more importantly, To Learn! After watching it it&#39;s so much easier understanding the whole process, so thank you very much!<br><br>- would like to sugeest one thing, would you be able to do one similar, teaching about APIs? I have no clue and wuld be a plus to complement this video. Always wanted to understand how writing a piece of code, and how that runs live or constantly, and how it connects to an API nad how then it connects and links with databases etc etc (my mind is very complex now and I have no clue but wuld want to learn more about it). I think I have seen most fo your videos, sorry if you already did one about this but I don&#39;t remember.<br><br>All the best and a great 2022"
36,I also forgot to comment that‚Äôs a lot of data! Like at least 3 üßê
37,I just started getting into the learning curve of becoming a data analyst and your videos have been super helpful‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
38,Data Nerds!  What&#39;s your biggest issue with working as a data analyst? (or even learning to be one?)
39,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAuuqdzC_rI&amp;t=03m43s"">03:43</a> &quot;I do think that you have to have a high enough salary in order to support your lifestyle&quot;<br>Real world translation...<br>--&gt; The salary you (are fortunate to?) receive DETERMINES your lifestyle!<br>--&gt; &#39;Levelling up&#39;, experience and lady luck are the primary determinants, with luck being the most important (frequently trumps experience and levelling up, frequently in a particularly unfair manner).<br>Bombshell: the vast, vast majority of working folks in this world are in jobs they do not enjoy.<br>Rule #1: While you sacrifice young/at the beginning, your &#39;real&#39; life is always outside work. Balance is key!"
40,"since you mentioned the influence of an individual on entry level job I, i guess like in most cases,any job ..you wouldn&#39;t get to have much of opinion or influence mostly it&#39;s you do the job and learn more to develop certain skill set to go further , so yeah that doesn&#39;t apply on data analyst only anyway xD thanks for sharing your insights"
41,"I&#39;d say your &quot;helping others&quot; section isn&#39;t no specific to data analysts. I&#39;ve been an IT Technician and now I&#39;m a software dev and in during my time in those roles I&#39;ve been asked (to mention a few) excel forumlas, document design, graphic art, 3d modelling, audio recordings / mixing, data analysis, plastering (yes as in wall plastering and yep, no joke), support calls for clients, client training, house calls to staff. I don&#39;t see this as being a negative though, if you can tell people no (when you don&#39;t have the time) and ensure your work is done, then it makes people think your indispensible (that is also a negative, as sometimes it can prevent career development as they don&#39;t want to lose so many skills from that department)."
42,"Luke - Thank you for putting these amazing contents out there! Like yourself, I became an accidental data analyst. Your experience so valuable to me to understand this field!"
43,Goddamn that vid√©o is spot-on!
44,I am planning to do my Masters in Business Analytics in the US to get into the field of Data analytics/science. I want to ensure that I get a great job at a decent firm in the US. I will be starting my master&#39;s in Fall 22. What do you suggest I do or divert my focus to for a better chance of landing jobs once I&#39;m in my master&#39;s degree? I have experience as a data analyst for 3 years.
45,"To be fair, a lot of the problems you mentioned are shared across most jobs."
46,Really insightful. Interesting point about investigating data before committing to the project. Company I work at makes all staff do &quot;data training&quot; to ensure people understand the importance of where data comes from and how it can be used.  It&#39;s a really big deal! Your videos are really great insights into how &#39;real world&#39; experience feels. Thanks!
47,Off topic...what are your thoughts on the EdX Harvard Professional Certificate in Data Science? Love your insight and your videos - Cheers!
48,I want to emphasize something that was not said in the video. <br>Domain Knowledge. <br><br>I was a Mechanical Engineering in manufacturing that switched to data analyst in health insurance. It was one of the most stressful job since I had to learn about the entire healthcare industry and its process. My supervisor told me that the analyst should be the smartest person in the room with the ability to answer all the questions management throws at you. I know that everyone&#39;s experience is different but im just saying what my transition was like. I switched to being a data engineer in manufacturing and never been more happier.
49,"Got more then just value, I got inspired."
50,Both of you guys are my biggest inspirations man.
51,datacazzz
52,"Hey Luke, I&#39;m now to your channel. I&#39;m currently preparing my exam for database fundamentals. Does data analyst also use EER schematic&#39;s. Also learning SQL is really fun! :)"
53,"lol.. you forgot &quot;your job is basically just copying code from github, right?&quot; and &quot;can we really trust data sciece, it&#39;s basically just a magic black box, right?&quot;"
54,I&#39;m having my technical interview for a position in data analytics tomorrow!
55,"As someone who has been a data analyst at a corporation for almost a decade, I feel you hit the nail on the head with most of this video.  Nice work giving people insight into the job!"
56,It looks like the salary range excludes senior data analysts. Is this because there are fewer of them and they exist only in bigger companies?
57,"I hate work as data analyst, but I really like job as data engineer.<br>I hate being constantly with stakeholders in useless meetings... Am introvert, I feel totally drained after those meetings"
58,"Data Nerds! What skill are you currently working on that is a non-technical skill (I.e. soft skill, analytical skill, domain knowledge)?"
59,Thanks so much for your video. I see so many videos geared towards Data scientists but not too many for analysts. I graduated Sept 2021 and I‚Äôm still looking for jobs but needed some motivation to not lose out on what I learned
60,thanks luke!!!
61,"It also useful for me as a beginner of financial analyst,  So gratefull for the video"
62,Stupid question‚Ä¶ why is the sub‚Äôs tower covered in polka dots? Wouldn‚Äôt that make it stand out more rather then camouflage?
63,"Hi Luke! I hope you see this... I am wondering if you have any resources for finding projects to practice with and talk about in interviews (like the nutrition one you discussed in this video). I feel like I have the educational background, but am having trouble translating that over to solving applied business problems. I could really use some practice solving problems and testing my knowledge but do not see any online resources for this. If you could point me in the right direction I would be very appreciative. Thank you!"
64,Thank you
65,"Fun, easy to follow .Thanks."
66,"That Data Nerds do have a sense of humor is proven! <br>Also not having a skipping talking face every few seconds, because of an edit was very nice. <br>The visuals were a great touch to bring you point across. <br><br>Thanks, will probably need rewatch this a couple of times. <br><br>Oh and ... I subscribed to your channel"
67,How did you find your first job in the field?
68,"I have been looking at a career change. I have about 18 years of retail management experience but before that, I went to college for Computer Information Systems. Back then, I learned programming languages like Pascal, Fortran, and Cobol. I became burned out while I was taking Calculus 2. Mainly because the instructor was more interested in writing a textbook than teaching the class. I want to break away from the retail environment into something that is less physically demanding. My technical skills, I feel are outdated. I have a new Chromebook and this sounds like a viable option for me. I would like to know your opinion since you are currently in the field."
69,Hey. I don&#39;t go to college and recently heard about the CS boot camp can get me a job after complete the certificate. Is there any recommendation in your mind? I&#39;m interest in data analyst and which boot camp would you recommend.
70,Thanks luke for your video. I want to start my career as data analyst. I am going to follow what you said.
71,From one Navy veteran to another - Thanks for posting this awesome video.  You inspired me to get started on the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate mentioned in this video.  Happy ‚Äúneeding‚Äù. Cheers!
72,This video is so good! I am planning on becoming a data analyst this year 2022.
73,"Excel happens to be still widely used, but the real value comes with R or Python. I honestly, have not conducted an anaylsis in Excel for years. As someone who is now hiring analysts, collaboration and reproducibility are just so much better in R or Python. Feel free ingest excel, but then compute in R or Python, and then output excel. In 2022‚Ä¶. Please, please don‚Äôt use MS Excel for analysis. Big red flag for a serious employer if ur showing off excel projects."
74,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC66RXeTn_4&amp;t=1m26s"">1:26</a> This is my biggest issue. I&#39;ve been doing end-user IT support for years....I really want to &#39;graduate&#39; to a more specialized IT role, but every time I get started doing cert prep for anything , I can&#39;t retain the info...by the time I get to chapter 4 I have no idea what I learned in chapter 1."
75,"I wish I would found your channel sooner. My Excel and analytical skills earned me a promotion from an Electronics Technician to a Business Analyst.  I&#39;m currently building adhoc and self-serve analytics in Tableau. I&#39;ve completed 3 Python specializations on Coursera. However, I haven&#39;t used Python in a professional setting yet. Wish I would have learned SQL before Python. That&#39;s what I need now to advance to the next level."
76,Thank you for these resources and road map :). This will help a whole lot so I truly appreciate.
77,Thank you!
78,"This is so wild Luke....you basically shared my personal learning roadmap. Started my DA journey in March 2021. Started with Google DA cert, then moved on to UC-Davis SQL Training, then the UC-Davis Tableau specialization. Already had previous working knowledge of Excel. I was able to use these courses to increase my pay by over 50% by quitting teaching and becoming a data analyst. Thank you for the recommendations on what are the best Python courses though, that is my next target. Suppose I can benefit from the Excel course too. Thank you for sharing these. Crazy to see how my own personal journey matched this video. Wish I had this video when I started, I had to compare and contrast on these courses on my own."
79,i wanna change my job. how long does it take to i am able to get the 1st job? Thanks
80,"I started in Jan 2022 and I finished the Google data analytics course in abt 12 days I really enjoyed the sql and R part of the course,but they&#39;re just basics which is good for a beginner like me but I&#39;m definitely continuing with your specialization courses.  Thanks alot man"
81,"How about the course that I take are like Intermediate or advanced, because I focus to master each of my skills, at SQL, Tableau and Python"
82,"Hey Luke, I&#39;m a Tech Recruiter now (former IT support/sys admin guy), however i may have an opportunity to join my company&#39;s Analytics and Intelligence team as an Analyst. Would you recommend th Google DA cert as my intro into the field?"
83,Great video and its very helpful! I just wonder do i need to start first with Google Data Analyst and then with other courses?
84,This guy really told us everything we have to do...respect (and subscribed) :)
85,Senior always on point love your content. Could you pls help me fine my ground can I do Data Analyst without Database Tech
86,"Hi mate ! how are you? I have been doing the Microsoft Certified: Data Analyst Associate, Do you think it is the same as google one? Or which is better  from your point of view .<br>Thank you so much"
87,"If you&#39;re still having hard time finding a job or even just after the google certificate (and a portfolio of 1-2 projects), would freelancing a bit work better than more personal projects? <br>Cause it sounds as if it would be a bit more impressing that you managed to answer clients demands.<br>I&#39;d love your insight about this.<br><br>Overall i like numbers, statistics and data analyzing (amateur level, no certificates), also i love problem solving and making processes more efficient! It seems as if buissnes analyst might be the best option for me. Machine learning and ai might be the next step to think after a few years as buissnes/data analyst, but I don&#39;t think it would work without a degree, at least one haha<br>Thank you for your time :)"
88,"Hi luke, and again thank you so much for all the informations, i&#39;m  new data nerd  from Montreal and I got my first course via coursera but I have a difficulty about ID Verification, every time they say picture note clear when , any idea? Thanks"
89,Thx so much for this video! Just started the Data analytics course a few weeks ago and This video has me even more excited!
90,This is perfect! Thank you so much üôè. Very clear road map that should keep me busy for a while.
91,"Hey Luke, firstly thank you for the great contents, I wanted to ask you few questions,<br>1. if I complete my Google analytics course and some other courses on course era and later cancel my subscription, will the finished courses will still be accessible later on?<br>2. As you have gained tons of experience in the field of data analysis, do you think pyspark and ELK stack will also be important skills as a data analyst?"
92,"Hi, Luke  thank you so much for all advices , after many years as web developer i decide to start new challenge to become data analytics  and i&#39; m gonna  follow all your recommendation   i have a question about excel , is it important for data analytics to learn VBA excel or no?you deserve an oscar for all informations  thank you Luke"
93,"in addition to learning the tools to perform data analysis, what basic knowledge is very supportive as a data analyst? Math? Stats? Or what? Thanks"
94,After all doing all these courses your looking at a good amount of time worth of studying . Wondering if it‚Äôs worth doing all this work for no degree in return
95,"If I like python with SQL Excel and power bi, ¬ø I can get a job?"
96,"Hi Luke! Thank you for all your great content. I am about to start a Sales position with an Artificial Intelligence startup. I&#39;d like to learn more about the domain of Data Analytics so I can speak to my customers more intelligently. Do you think the Google Data Analytics Certificate would be worth my time? Or, would it be enough to just stay up to date on all your videos? <br><br>For reference, my degrees are in Engineering and I&#39;ve spent the last 3.5 years in sales with an Internet of Things startup."
97,Another GREAT informative video brother     Thanks üôè
98,Data Nerds! üíªüë®üèº‚Äçüíªüñ• I&#39;m curious if you have data science jobs that DO or DON&#39;T RELY on a particular OPERATING SYTEM‚ùì
99,Everybody knows that Linux is the only proper way to go.
100,"So basically,  the pros for Windows are: it supports everything, it does not need workarounds, and it is cheaper. <br>The pros for Mac are: &quot;I like Apple,  and with a few tricks it can work as well as Windows&quot;<br><br>Got it ;)"
101,You could setup that your menu bar shows up on fullscreen and set your apps on fullscreen then. This way you maximize your 16‚Äú real estate.
102,just get an external ssd or use bootcamp
103,"Hi bro, I am at beginner level and want to learn Ms Excel, Power Bi, SQL &amp; Python. Where to start? &amp; which online platform should i use to learn them?"
104,Would you recommend a Microsoft Go to get started?
105,Why settle for less? Get Linux üòÇ
106,"Hey, Thanks for the video Luke. I am just starting out to learn data analytics and was thinking of maybe getting a MacBook but this video helped."
107,Hi. What do you recommend For stata ana spss? The MacBook air continue been your choice..?
108,"I love that <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4vh2EClJic&amp;t=2m49s"">2:49</a>  &quot;data nerd&quot; has become a unit of measure for this channel ü§£"
109,How come you don&#39;t have a Apple Watch to complete the Holy Fruit Trinity ?
110,"No, it doesn&#39;t mean Macs are more likely to be selected for data science. It just means relatively more Mac lover data scientists watch your channel. it&#39;s called selection bias, you can&#39;t compare your poll to a nationally representative survey. Anyhow, still an  interesting video."
111,"The 2 biggest factors for Windows dominance: Corporate culture and software suport, and the corporate culture ensures that dev companies aways prioritize windows, so its a loop. And from the tools you used as an example, I&#39;d say the only reason you&#39;d use them is corporate culture. SQL Server isn&#39;t a big deal, so is power bi,  but you can&#39;t choose if the company you work for decides for you. I&#39;m not a data analyst though, so maybe I&#39;m wrong."
112,"Hey Luke, thanks for your videos they‚Äôre awesome, just wanted to ask you if you know a way you could recommend or do a video on how set up MSSQL Server working in M1 MacBooks"
113,&quot;half a data nerd&quot; üòÇ
114,"Maybe as a data analyst windows is better, but for data science and engineering, linux and Mac are way better due to ease of installing things with apt and home brew. And the fact that working on the terminal helps you working in the cloud as well!"
115,Linux all the way. The power of the terminal + the price of a normal PC!
116,"Poll is biased because more people have windows laptop. If you will adjust for that bias, it will be 1:1. I myself use windows but I think new mac with m1 looks great as per reviews and I might opt for that when looking for my next laptop."
117,"Some problems are that you polled your audience which may be skewed toward mac. Additionally, you used the general world statistics for your control group. If you audience is predominantly from USA, then the control market share for macos is higher."
118,Yea but actually no :/ I could only afford the  8gb M1 MacBook air. Aaaaand it heats up and dies on my most intensive tasks.
119,Yeahh will you deliver to india
120,Give it to me.
121,I can buy it. But i can only pay the price of a macbook air at maxü§£ü§£
122,It‚Äôs all fun and games until tensorflow gets apple silicon support
123,"Cool. Carry out some more tests üòÄ would be helpful for someone like me, who&#39;s planning to buy M1"
124,How can I test this code on my PC?
125,"Here a m1 air user, don&#39;t buy it if you are going to do heavy work there. Especially with 8gb of ram, it slows everything down a ton, if you get it, at least get 16gb of ram.<br><br>It also throtles sometimes"
126,$50!!!
127,What test did you ran? Was it like generating a sequence? Comparing only CPU? Or was it also drive speed?
128,Should a person go for 8gb or 16gb varient?
129,üòÖüëç
130,Can I buy the Mac?
131,"Anyone has comments about the ram tho? My 16gb windows laptop is like 90% all the time, also I hate swap."
132,Run a parallelised code. <br>Serial code will take similar time even on a super commuting cluster

137,"no the best code in all of history is clearly JS,"
138,I found your video while looking for a laptop for college as I will be majoring in Data Science. Do you think a MacBook Air 16 RAM/1 TB will be enough or should I get a base model MacBook Pro 14? Or should I wait for the M2 Air?
139,"I found your video review by chance and my immediate reaction, as someone who frequently needs to do substantial data processing using Excel (and is beyond frustrated with Windows laptop performance), was &quot;at last !&quot;. Trouble is, the Excel section of your review was (paraphrasing) &#39;pretty good, but use a Windows machine is you need some specific functionality&#39;. This tells me almost nothing about the capabilities and relative performance of an M1 Max/Pro, either versus Windows machines, or versus the standard M1 chips. With Excel having such a huge user base I thought you&#39;d cover the performance of this software in far more detail."
140,"Thank you for your clear and understandable video. This is exactly what I was looking for. Currently I started my job as a data scientist/analyst, and I am considering to get M1 Pro 14 base model w 1TB. What I&#39;m wondering now is if I would ever need to upgrade memory to 32gb. Do you think either 32gb memory or advanced cpu and gpu option is worthy enough to spend about $400 as a rookie in data science? bcs this option isn&#39;t cheap at all it&#39;s so hard to choose;)"
141,&quot;Max is overkill&quot;.....as I purchase a 17in Razer blade with i9 12th gen 64gb ram and a 3080. When Google Collab would more than suit my needs. ü§£
142,Found exactly the video that I was looking for. Explained to the point covered everything that i hoped for being a Data Analyst. Thanks for the video. I think I&#39;ll go with M1 13inch pro. Thats more than enough. No point in getting m1 pro and max
143,"This is 2022. Not sure why YouTubers are even testing laptop GPUs when we have cloud GPUs for free or almost free. Don&#39;t think anyone is going to be training on the Nile River with no WiFi.

148,Can I use windows most of the time on the base M1 Air 8GB for beginner development/data analytics through Parallels without any issues as if it&#39;s simply a windows laptop?
149,the ports coming back for the m1 pro is tempting me very much lol
150,Excellent video! Covered everything nicely.
151,"Hi Luke, I&#39;m planning to get a macbook but I&#39;m still confused if to get 13&quot; M1 or 14&quot;M1Pro. I&#39;m using VSC, VS, MqSQL, MOngoDB, Adobe XD, premier, illustrator, photoshop and  some jetbrains like webstorm. Would you recommend M1 to handle all these stuff? I&#39;m a budget conscious and M1Pro is bit stiff for me. I appreciate your thoughts and recommendation. Thanks!"
152,Great breakdown. Sadly all the mac book pros are out of stock for like the next two to three weeks...
153,What I was looking for. Perfect. You got a sub.
154,Were you able to get Windows 10 working under Parallels for the M1 Pro or M1 Max systems?  I am under the impression you have to use Windows 11 to work under Parallels on these chips.
155,SD card slot and HDMI are not PRO they should be standard!! Good video otherwise.
156,considering they are gonna upgrade to M2 MacBook next Spring.  better wait few months
157,This was the perfect review for me. Thanks so much!
158,"Hi Luke, I hope you are doing well.<br>I know that it is motivating for content creators that subscribers share stories, so this is a short version of mine.<br>I am currently a Bioengineering student in Buenos Aires (Arg) and I have always been interested in the world of data science. Thanks to your channel I was able to structure a path to follow in order to combine these two skills and fulfill myself as a professional and a person.<br>Thank you so much for everything !<br>Agustin."
159,Nice looping! Great content as always
160,"Hi luke, i just want to ask you about the remote jobs opportunities for data analyst , is it possible for a foreigner (from Algeria) to get a remote data analyst job in the US !!! <br>Thanks for answering"
161,Where can I get the projects? Any website in specific?
162,What do u eat in a day?
163,@Luke Barousse  can i ask you for your opinion about practicum yandex data analyst certificate
164,you are great one
165,I dont care if this is an Ad. Cursera is freaking good and is worth it
166,Today I‚Äôm Thankful for your content!!! ü¶Éü¶Éü¶É
167,"Hi Luke, One of the things I struggle to grasp is how to use our tools and skills to make recomendations to employers. A lot of the time Employers don&#39;t know what the data means and its our Job to determine what the data means. What&#39;s the best way to learn this skill outside of real world experience? Or is that the only way?"
168,Just a Short Question: Are your working as a Data Analyst and want to become a Data Scientiest? Or are you just learning Skills Form Data Science to be a Better Data Analyst?<br>I know the skillset is quit similar but was is your Motivation?
169,Lets start building some basic projects.
170,hey luke as a starter should i go directly to google data analytics  course can you give road map to me i know mysql and java
171,"Hi Luke I was wondering is the new m1 Mac mini 16gb good for data ankyst work, are any software or tools you use not working on m1?"
172,"Great video Luke! :) I also am a big fan of Cousera, as well as Datacamp!"
173,"Hahaha I feel this! Got my degree in data science, work as a data analyst but trying to learn skills of a data engineer! Think I like the data analyst and engineer part more too! Great video!!"
174,jajajajajjaja
175,"Holy hahahahaha now im seeing that im also interested in data engineering, so i guess ill take some courses on both and have a wider experience haha"
176,"&quot;6 months. Minimum.&quot; This was so insanely accurate, I kind of cried a little"
177,This is brilliant! Thank you for all of the work you put into the channel because you&#39;ve been a fantastic resource as I continue to work toward transitioning from education to data analytics. You rock sir!
178,üòÇüòÇüòÇ
179,What the Fu**!!!! LOL
180,I damn near fell out when you had The data engineer in the closet üòÇüòÇ
181,I love Dags XD
182,"At least consider Andrew Ng and Fei-fei Li in the frame pictures, the fake data scientist!"
183,You should def do tech reviews and data course recommendations for people unfamiliar with the field. They would be a blast!
184,OMG I just saw this HAHAHA I am greatly honoured
185,Jajaajjaajajaa ‚ù§Ô∏è
186,I LIKE the new guy!!!! . . . . . . . buuuuuuut ü§î . . . . wasn&#39;t there ANOTHER guy locked in the closet? üôÑ
187,"I have done my <a href=""http://b.tech/"">b.tech</a> Mechnical in 2015 but no experience so iam able for data science. Please Help me"
188,Sorry your not getting anything done without the project manager and business analyst. ‚ò∫Ô∏è
189,this shit is so funny :((((((((((
190,"Congrats again on the 100K, Luke! This video cracked me up. The facial expressions killed me. ü§£"
191,"I like your videos , it&#39;s really amazing and useful to me"
192,Nice!!!
193,Where do you usually go to collect data for your data science projects? üë®üèº‚Äçüíªüìäü§ñüìà
194,Hey Hi Luke Add more videos I like your explanation and you are doing nice work.
195,"Very cool - i actually wanted to download my connections skills for a data science project, but got too busy with work  . . . but i would realy only need a 1-time download, i think?  idk, thanks for reminding me of this project idea anyways!"
196,Thts amazing.  Motivates me to do the same
197,You look like the brother of Kalle Hallden
198,How much time do you put into these projects including the googling and the learning?
199,Once i used to slow down abit  the script so that i could avoid recapcha
200,"Some very interesting points around click wraps, etc... Keen to see where you take this one."
201,I was actually thinking about doing something similar earlier this year and was excited to see that LinkedIn had an API!  Now it&#39;s been too long and they got rid of it which makes me disappointed.  They made that change just this year.
202,Do you have a WhatsApp bot?
203,How can I contact you if I want you to <br>A bot for me?
204,"Funny coincidence‚Ä¶ last semester during a project i was also scraping job data for jobs with the search terms: data governance, data culture etc. and i encountered exactly the same issue. Now this video pops up :D"
205,Is there any site other than google to get a free data analysis course from with certificate ?
206,This is a great followup to the earlier video. I&#39;d hoped when you posted the previous video you would follow up with information on ethically dealing with the TOS limitations on various sites.  Looking forward to further followup.
207,Dude you look like DR house
208,but I still dont know how LinkedIn discovered that you use scraper. maybe you access too frequently ? scroll too fast? or your access is python request?
209,"The data is publicly available without logging in to LinkedIn. However I noticed certain filter fields like easy apply, and experience level and unavailable."
210,that was the coolest thing i have ever seen
211,I saw an &quot;entry level&quot; data analyst job that required 6-8 years experience!
212,"Thanks for sharing Luke, I am also building my internet scraper to gather house data, hope I do not run into similar banning issues!! ü§û"
213,"Have you heard of (or even used) this new feature on LinkedIn?<br><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/services"">https://www.linkedin.com/services</a>"
214,"Could you do a follow up on how to market pricing? I‚Äôve been interested in getting into this on the side, but have always been unsure on pricing depending on the various factors/requirements. Thanks!"
215,Congratulations on the subs man. Been here for a long time. Can‚Äôt wait to watch you explode.
216,Holy MOLY. <br><br>Competition‚Ä¶ oh man‚Ä¶ gotta work hard.
217,Made it to 100k subs!!!!! Congrats! That‚Äôs a pretty hefty group of subs!
218,I can&#39;t see this option in my linkedin app
219,Damn- This feature will greatly boost LinkedIn&#39;s potential. Epic Short Luke!
220,What is your DREAM JOB in data science?!? (.....or favorite Mario character... ü§£)
221,"For data analytics content creators, your videos are the best produced and most objective on YouTube."
222,Thanks for the video. It is very informative.
223,"I can&#39;t thank you enough<br><br>I&#39;m kinda still a student, but I&#39;m extremely terrified of the idea &quot;being an adult&quot; and &quot;go to job&quot;<br><br>I really need to understand, and that&#39;s how I find this lovely video of yours<br><br>thanks"
224,"Nice work Luke, this was orchestrated well and nicely curated by you. I appreciate how you blended the various experiences, topics and trajectory of each participating interviewee."
225,"Hi Luke, Thanks for this informative video. Can you create more content about data managers or data strategists? It sounds like they do project management for analytics work? I‚Äôd be keen to know the skill sets that folks like them need to succeed, the challenges they face, and what they do everyday at work. Thanks again."
226,Wow pretty concise video. Subscribed.
227,Thorough and well put. I liked.
228,"this is very helpful, keep doing the great work mr.luke"
229,You reference Coursera in multiple videos<br>What&#39;s your take on ther CS BSc via UoL?
230,This video deserves more views
231,so basically data scientist in data science is like the full stack engineer in software engineering
232,So glad I found your channel!
233,"I started studying data science a few months ago and I realize that now I understand what a data scientist says, I feel like I have passed a step, it&#39;s very satisfying."
234,"Great insight, appreciate your video."
235,Very well simplified. Thank you sharing this content
236,"Thank you for creating this awesome and informative video! I‚Äôm about to graduate next month and am still trying to figure out what type of role I wanna work toward, so this was really insightful and encouraging! I appreciate it! üòÅ"
237,"Just as a data point (made a throwaway for privacy), I&#39;m an incoming Data Analyst with 1.5 YOE making $100k a year. For aspiring analysts, don&#39;t let salary get in the way if that&#39;s what you want to do. The market wants them."
238,Great video Luke. I enjoyed it!
239,"this is a very comprehensive, thank you!"
240,i depend on you with the m1 pro/max review since are the only one i know who test programming apps
241,love from indiaüíñ
242,"Hey Luke, cover the macbook m1 max, pleaseeeee"
243,Hi luke what do you think i have to focus if i want to become an it security and compliance analyst. Please help me because i don‚Äôt know where to start.
244,it&#39;s been 3 weeks since you uploaded this video. hope you are well.
245,I like where you&#39;re going with this!
246,How do you look up credible data to import?
247,Thank you for the recommendations.<br><br>:)
248,Great video! Can&#39;t wait to for the next part!
249,So helpful Luke!  Thanks!
250,"HAHA, what a fun and informative video as usual.<br>Can&#39;t wait to utilise your advice."
251,Sweet as*! You&#39;re less than 10k subs away from that 6 digit subs! Congrats in advance Luke!
252,probably my most viewed channel. im very much interested in this and mainly the tools used. so can there be a detailed step-by-step guide on how the tasks are carried out?
253,Awesome video Luke! Looking forward to seeing the next videos of the series!
254,I recently made a mistake and got a dataset before I hopped on a plane ride and started to clean the data once the plane took off. I thought it would be a quick and easy Tableau project but I had more questions and needed to look up how to somethings in Tableau. Lesson learned.....
255,"If you really want to stand out, build a simple pipeline that takes financial statements from your financial regulation agency and put them in a T-SQL database.<br><br>Things you‚Äôll need:<br><br>1. a database hosted locally.<br>2. links to the datasets.<br>3. Python and specially SQLmodel<br>4. Some tool to query the data, either VScode or DataGrip.<br><br>That will show potential employers that you now how to parse and pre process data from the web and do sth good with it."
256,Thank you Luke. Will be following this series. Currently learning python for analytics after following your channel for some months.
257,What a great channel for us rare few that enjoy data. I‚Äôm working to leave my current job and go get my masters in data science. Wish me luck Luke :)
258,"Luke&#39;s video pops, <b>grabs popcorn</b> Awesome stuff. Super helpful!"
259,"Love this channel.  I&#39;m really excited to get back to Data Analytics. I&#39;ve been taking care of my dad (dementia) he is no longer with us. So now back to focusing on the Analytics. I&#39;ve got a background in management, real estate, and government contracting."
260,"I learned Python before R, and based on my experience, the choice of programming language depends on the type of data objects I am working on. For example, sequence objects like ‚Äòstrings‚Äô are very well handled in Python; there‚Äôs just so much you can do with it, like with parsing DNA sequences or text files from the web. User-defined functions that contain loops are also not a problem in terms of memory allocation. Python scripting is also used along with the ‚Äòimage‚Äò processing tool FIJI. However,  for manipulating and visualizing tabular data, R is just more elegant for me. I‚Äôm still new to R, but I find ‚Äòdata frame‚Äô objects more easily accessible and visuals easier to code and just look more stunning in R, plus you can do all sorts of statistical analyses. However, since R uses ‚Äòvectors‚Äô, e.g. a string is considered a vector of length 1, I‚Äôm just not yet so sure how much you can do with strings or how inefficient it could get as compared with Python."
261,says the guy wearing a shirt telling you he is/was a marine....
262,"for a data analyst, R is not enough, R is better"
263,"I am a python fanboy, but just learn both."
264,"For some, in data analytics, learning Python may very well be an unneeded distraction, when R is so much more to the point. Learn the one language you need, and learn it well. Google just might have it right here."
265,BI and such are excellent until it becomes time to share. As being proprietary they gum up the works when attempting to share interactive works. R has excellent visualisation and is open source solving both problems with a web page. Why waste time??
266,"R is definitely easier to get going with, when compared to Python. Python is less intuitive if you&#39;re not already programming in another language."
267,I lost you at ‚Äúdata‚Äù.
268,come on python fanboys data analysts mostly do reporting for c level and exactly this is working much better with R libraries than python. ML is not this important here.
269,Sometimes you say the same things again and again üòü. Overall very informative but editing can be better.
270,Great objective video!
271,I love your content!! thank you very much!!!!
272,"JavaScript is easiest to learn, compared to python, imo. Especially when you write a function with def instead func, thats counter intuitive. Or when there are no braces just tabs to indent code. You accidentally push the code by one space and the entire block doesn&#39;t execute. JS also gives you immediate visual reward by running the code in your browser or just console log it"
273,Shiny is a big advantage to R over Python.
274,Thank you Luke for all the good stuff.
275,There are many entry level DA job just let you do the data validation and SQL part. Don‚Äôt worry too much about R/Python. Eventually your job will force you to pick up both lol
276,Should I learn Python or R for business analyst?
277,LOL @ &quot;once I understood that R is barbaric&quot; i died laughing
278,"I once wrote a program in  R and it took 40 minutes to process 200+ CSV files and this was not acceptable.  I re-wrote the program in python and it completed the task in 3 minutes.  I then put R aside and specialized in python.   Be good in one language R/python but really good.  it is better to be good at one language really well than being a master of none :) .  R script is a little simplier than python but  once you get familiar, python is fun and powerful"
279,What are you doing to showcase your experience?
280,"I love this video, so inspiring. Thank you Luke."
281,Did these folks have college degree? S
282,El Maestro! Bravo!
283,I have my masters and decided to make a career change  currently doing the Google data analytics certificate and this video helped me out alot was worried when I saw job ads and everyone wants exp and I&#39;m like is this entry level
284,Loved this video
285,&quot;I&#39;ve been watching YouTube videos on data science for two years is that enough experience?&quot; üòÇ
286,"Ohhhhhhh, you were a submariner office. That explains soooo much lol. I spent 11 years in the Navy (OS1), got my degree in math. I didn&#39;t do an internship so I started off as an assistant PM. Worked my way into the position of a BI analyst. Did great in that role, moved into new position and was able to identify a big issue in my company and solved it for them. This opened me up to my current role doing doing data science thingy&#39;s for our revenue arm. If you can show that you can make money for a company, the sky is the limit. Now I&#39;m like an officer in the Navy and barely work for a living :)"
287,Your videos are so much useful to people comparing to other viral videos on Youtube! I hope you know that!!
288,great
289,Where can I find end to end data science project tutorials?
290,This was a very valuable video.
291,Can you do freelance as a Data analyst ?
292,dude...thanks. subd
293,"Hey Luke, do you recommend Udacity Data Analysis Nanodegree for learning and creating a portfolio? I‚Äôve seen a lot of people saying that it‚Äôs a big opportunity to learn and also create a portfolio and land a job. Thanks!"
294,nice content
295,"I really Needed this video, Thanks Luke"
296,Thanks for putting this together Luke! I didn&#39;t know it was already out!
297,"Hey Luke! First at all, BIG Thank You for this Awesome content! I am working in a career change from IT Project Management to Data Science-Data Analytics. I was feeling really lost until I found your channel ! it has provide me gold information and guidance about my next steps, this is one of the best content available for sure. If possible I would love to learn from you about the main differences between a data scientist and data analyst (analytics). This is still a bit confusing. Keep it up and again, Thank You!"
298,I have studied statistic can i become a data scientist ??
299,Do you have a portfolio website to share? Drop it below üëáüèº
300,This is a great video.. You have inspired me to pursue Data Analysis.
301,Great content Luke! I&#39;ll be creating my portfolio website soon!
302,"I love your video, easily understand. Thank Luke!"
303,"Oh shit man, I spat out my coffee when I saw you spit out your coke ü§£"
304,"Your videos are so clear, concise and to the point."
305,This is great; thank you.
306,Superb advice üòé
307,"Hi sir saw your website, very well defined with lots of info.<br>Sir I am using my phone most. And I don&#39;t have laptop currently, so what platform can I download to learn python"
308,"Very informative, beautiful video especially the WordPress part. Please make a video on WordPress."
309,"Amazing recommendations, Thank you so much Luke"
310,"While I agree the upfront time to design a website from scratch is non-trivial, a cleanly designed, template-based, static website generator built from scratch can be a time-saver long-term. The website can serve a dual purpose: a professional-looking on-line presence demonstrating communication skills, and a unified platform to showcase your projects. Additiionally, it is surprisingly easy to deploy a self-hosted, low-resource git server for your domain."

315,Awesome! Thanks Luke. Just the info I was looking for!
316,Right on time! I need this!
317,"Such a great one, like 99.9% of your videos! Thank you so much:)"
318,Thanks for all of this information Luke!! I have been working on my portfolio for over a week now and have been struggling to find the right design. Knowing the basics a portfolio website should includes really makes it easier for me to narrow it all down!
319,DATA NERDS! What project are you currently working on for your portfolio (or job)?
320,"You never disappoint with your contents, thanks so much Luke! And to your friend too :)"
321,Brilliant. This is valuable. Thank you üôèüèæ

324,"Hey Luke,<br>Thanks so much for this video it was really helpful for a self learner like me."
325,Could you make this vedio as a podcast (like the whole intraction)
326,Very nice and informative video that clearly outlines how should one go about building your data science portfolio. Thanks for sharing !!
327,"super helpful for an aspiring &quot;data professional&quot;! (Data analyst or Data scientist or Data engineer, TBD)  Thank you!"
328,Tai Lopez? ü§£
329,i have been collecting data of my sets at the gym. i have made a notebook for it. i might end up making a data story for it.
330,Amazing useful video! Thanks!
331,Amazing content! You got a new follower :)
332,"Very Informative video, Thanks"
333,This is so helpful!
334,Unfortunately thats not how it works in my country. We apply using system. But the system itself will divide you into categories what jobs you can apply base on your education level and what is your education background
335,Good resume means nothing if you can&#39;t pass the first round coding challenge.
336,It&#39;s just pronounced jango the d is silent. Dont want anyone having an awkward moment in their interview when they say da-jango and the interviewer corrects them.
337,"Excellent video! Highly recommend everyone not just to do projects for jobs but for their own learning experience. At the beginning of this year I wanted to learn to build apps in Shiny and ended up building one to predict how long it will take to learn a piano piece based on its difficulty, length, genre, etc. This was possible because I compiled over 1,200 hours of practice (by piece) in the last 3-4 years so thought Id make use of it. It also taught me how to use APIs to get that data which the titanic dataset doesn‚Äôt really teach so yet another point for personal projectsüòÖ Not only that this was always a topic when I interviewed for DS roles but I also submitted it to the R Studio annual contest and won a notable mention. This is not the grand prize or anything but I was competing against full time shiny developers as someone that learnt this on the side for a couple months so was pretty proud of myself lol"
338,it‚Äôs pronounced data not data
339,Really nice ü§£
340,that database tragedy tho... freaking real lol
341,jejejejej
342,"Dude, I&#39;m currently a Data Science major student, and you are scaring the sht out of me ü§£"
343,That&#39;s so true !! How could all of this happen exaclty with me? hahahaha
344,"Damn, when i got this job i expected ay least someproject introduction as your ‚Äúreality‚Äù they just told me, there is the project and we need this for tomorrow"
345,Nice video...so funny tooü§£ü§£
346,Do data analysts also build models as well ? I thought this was something scientists did ?
347,"um, no comment"
348,Looking for Alex&#39;s comment
349,This applies to 99% of other areas in business with 99.99% precision.
350,I absolutely love your channel. Definitely hitting some pain points in my new role right now lol.
351,"Module not found, interesting."
352,It‚Äôs so reeeeeaaaaaaaaaaaaal jjajajajaj ‚ù§Ô∏è
353,Hahahahahahhahaha!!!!!!!!!!!
354,&quot;That was so easy to connect&quot; HAHAHHAH

358,lmao this was so relatable. i spent a whole day once trying to connect to the database and it turns out they hadn&#39;t added me to the file with the credentials
359,What&#39;s your tactic for staying motivated in your data science journey?
360,Hooyah!!!
361,"Broken code, bugs are part of our life. Fortunately you have youtube with kind people sharing tutorials"
362,I always seem to struggle with the mini celebration part. I keep thinking that the mini celebration is either to small or to big compared to the part of the task i just did. What are some things that you do/use for your mini celebrations. Thanks.
363,I haven&#39;t even watched the video yet. I simply liked it because of the title. üòÖ
364,cs_anal - sounds like a weird Counter Strike map if you ask me.
365,"What, no power query?"
366,"Good luck with your journey. I&#39;m gonna take a ML course next semester I have some programming experience, but no experience with python do you have any suggestions?"
367,"Sir please make a video on Google Data analytics apprenticeship , What it is and what are the benefits."
368,Great video!
369,"Hey Luke, can you do one for applying to new data analytics roles and what is the approach needed for them?"
370,"Hey Luke, I hope you are doing well. I had a question on which you can make a video I guess.<br><br>So the question is, &quot;What is the scope of Analytics? Are we just facing a boom in Analytics and thus it would fade away in say next 10 years or not?&quot; Also would data science jobs would have much relevance or not in the future?<br><br>Thanks for creating this amazing content<br>Keep up the good work!!"
371,I just listen to 1 hour of David Goggins each morning. STAY HARD.
372,I smashed that like button 1min before the end!Thanks a lot for the tips and for this kind of motivated videos üëç
373,thank you for this video
374,Great<br>You and alex The Analyst are the most helpful YouTuber for me ‚ù§Ô∏è keep going üôè
375,Yo Luke! Great points! That&#39;s exactly how I tackle when I hit rock bottom in data analysis! Never knew it was the same tactics that the navy/army did too!
376,Where can I get the panda üêº photo?<br>Need it for my teacher
377,"inspiring,<br>also I think Samurais have somehow same method.<br>They say: in a fight, if your every move is right, winning comes to you by itself.<br>Thanks for video, needed that."
378,"Great video, I not long ago I have decided to change my career and wish to become data analyst. All topics included in the career have been mentioned and to be fair it has been bit overwhelming. Currently i want to learn python as one of  steps towards becoming data analyst. Would you recommend learning videos/books covering python in general or more targeted info specifically for data science?"
379,Roll Call!  Are you a recent Google Data Analytics Certificate grad? üôãüèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
380,"I am basically already a data scientist without the title but trying to get into the tech world. I‚Äôm on course 6/8 and have mixed feelings about the certificate but overall think it was great and structured well.<br><br>Did I need the certificate? Not really, I already knew the technical skills the course offered so I‚Äôm not sure there is any benefit to me putting it on my resume.<br><br>Is it still worth taking? I think it is great for someone like me who has a degree that is science related but doesn‚Äôt have professional business experience. Like the guests mentioned it is heavy on the process and decision making. I learned a lot of buzz words and other information that will help me interview well and definitely helped me develop a solid resume.<br><br>Is this good for someone with no experience? Absolutely. As someone who already analyzes data and constantly creates methodology, I can say the structure of the course is really about getting you used to thinking analytically. It‚Äôs also a great intro to technical skills although these alone will not get you a job since it‚Äôs a little barebones.<br><br>Do I recommend the certificate? Yes but only if you have motivation. If you are serious about a career in data analytics this is a good precursor to your career you just have to want it and have patience. You aren‚Äôt going to want to hear this but this is likely a baby step to getting to that career. You have to continue to develop the technical skills, update your resume, and make a portfolio or git."
381,Hey I have one year of experience in Machine learning engineering already. Moving to data analyst should I go with IBM and then tableau specialization ? Because python is more easy for me haven&#39;t tried R. After completing both specialization can I get any remote data analyst job as junior ? P.s I have few more questions can I do a personal msg to you ?... last but not the least Stay safe mate  ü§ç
382,So one of the worlds largest and richest companies tried to make a free education system to get people jobs and it did bugger all.
383,Great video
384,This is a great video Luke where you are asking the right questions that anyone (including me) who wants to take the Google Certificate to get a headstart in DA role.
385,I wish they would teach Python rather than R
386,I am in the fifth course
387,I just got my certificate 2 hours ago now ready to find a job
388,"I subscribed.  This info is top notch, sir."
389,Good stuff. Imma keep building my portfolio üí™
390,Ok this is a really good and informative video thank you
391,Loved the diverse perspectives! I‚Äôd love to hear how Antonio got his internship.
392,"As for today I am having troubles finding a remote data analyst job, can someone refer me or at least help me with some doubts?"
393,"Wow this was super useful along with all of your videos on GDA. Thanks for the info, I signed up for the professional certificate and am enjoying it so far üíØ<br>You&#39;re doing God&#39;s worküëèüèΩ"
394,"Realistically, Im one of the unfortunate few that didn‚Äôt get a job with this certification. Got the certification, haven‚Äôt used it at all. No one wants to give you a chance because you learned this even though you want to show them you can do the job. No connections = no job, no experience. Waste of $45<br><br>Be realistic. If you got the job, doesn‚Äôt mean everybody will get it too. Congrats if you did get a job with this."
395,Love your videos man. Keep up the great work!
396,Which is the best course for job oprritunities? would love to see a vid on that. Maybe comparing the different courses
397,"Hey there Luke! I wanna thank you for sharing the knowledge such selflessly, and also wanted to praise you for replying to every comment out there. I‚Äôve been watching your videos for some time. Much respect &amp; love bro!<br><br>I‚Äôm a physics dropout, so this means I have only high school certificate. I got interested in Google‚Äôs Data Analytics course and IT Automation with Python course. Can I land a remote job or do freelancing with these ‚Äúcertificates‚Äù. Will employers take me seriously without college background or experience in corporate world?<br><br>I‚Äôm 29, currently jobless and desperate! I can give 12-15 hrs everyday (except weekend) to these courses and can finish them both within 50 days (I‚Äôm good with math, attention to details and communication).<br><br>What should be my course of action be? Since you‚Äôre a successful Data Analyst, your guidance on this will be highly appreciated and considered. Thank you and God bless! ‚ù§Ô∏è"

399,Poll time! What field/career are you transitioning into data science from?
400,is it possible for a non-American data analyst who lives in another country to work for an American company remotely? and thanks for  sharing your great journey and experience
401,"As always, such an amazing quality and content Luke!"
402,can you tackle the topic of automating dashboards?
403,Having social anxity I was wondering if you think this would be a good career change?
404,Very good and practical advice. I&#39;m looking into transitioning into this field. Thanks!
405,bro power bi is no data science xD <br>Any business user can build dashboards within few hours
406,"&quot;Self education&quot; is a necessary &quot;evil&quot; not just in data science but most of I.T. as well. Products / tools and their enhancements are coming out at a lightening pace. And formal education is challenged to keep up. It seems like most courses that are six months to a year old are &quot;outdated&quot; as there are always new and better ways to do things. Online courses and video content do have the flexibility of being quick and easy to produce and update, but it seems like some still need to have an &quot;expiration date&quot; on them."
407,"Great video Luke! I&#39;m currently on myt path to switch my career from HR Analyst into Data Analyst. I&#39;ve have a background in payroll analytics, and my learning path is focused on Google Data Analytics Certificate, Python, SQL and Tableau. Future looks so promising! Thanks for the inspiration!"
408,"Ohh man... This video was for me! <br>I worked as a Police officer in S√£o Paulo, Brazil, and in my job, I used to work with datas. I used to make all action&#39;s strategies, where, when, how and what we needed to do to give protection feelings to people, and stop a probably crime or bad behavior.<br>All my data studies to apply the actions were made through Excell Lol... I&#39; ve never imagined that data analysis or science exist... Now, about 1 month I&#39;m though on those, I&#39;ve started python and MySQL studies... And man... I can say it &quot;I love this job, learn and work with it&quot;."
409,"Dude, badass!"
410,I salute you sir. You are the man of the man in data profession
411,This is a really really cool video and I was inspired a lot... do more videos in this way...
412,Super impressive!
413,Thank you for putting this out! I think you&#39;re the first Veteran I came across who is doing what you&#39;re doing. This is really beneficial for all Veterans looking to transition in the analytics world.
414,Working towards a marketing degree do you suggest internships in data analysis or data science?
415,üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ the interview part
416,Well done. Nice journey you had buddy üíõ<br><br>Can&#39;t wait to begin mine.
417,"Good stuff!  I transitioned away from biology into clinical data management after learning SQL and SAS.  Now I&#39;m working in a data analytics role in the healthcare industry after learning Python, R, and a bit of Tableau.  It&#39;s all about trying to leverage what you&#39;ve learned from previous positions and applying your domain-specific knowledge when possible."
418,Too bad Deep Mind and quantum computing will make this particular field obsolete for humans within oh......a decade if things straighten out or on the outside (WAY outside) maybe 50 years.  Fact.
419,What&#39;s your favorite tool to use?
420,"Greetings Luke,<br><br>I discovered this video only today.  It&#39;s awesome! Without going into gut-wrenching detail, I&#39;ll just say I have lived some of the nightmares you describe.  VERY frustrating when I know there are MUCH better tools available today than the standard apps loaded on my work laptop.  Anyway, that part of my reality isn&#39;t going to change anytime soon, so I choose to make do the best I can, work smart - rather than hard, and stay focused on developing new data analyst skills that might open a door to an organization that believes in using the proper tool for the job at hand.  <br><br>Thanks again for all of the content you produce and share.<br><br>Cheers!<br>~B~"
421,"This reminds me of the coronavirus cases going unreported in he UK at the start of the pandemic. They were using Excel, and the amount of data was much greater than Excel could handle."
422,Thank you.
423,Trying to explain this to stakeholders who are joined at hip to Excel is such a struggle lol üòÇ
424,For large amounts of data Power Query in Excel: compiled folder with over 2000 Excel files and 61 million rows no worries. Just a bit slow xd
425,"great video! I major in Information System and I have been taught some lessons such as Power BI, C++ and I don&#39;t know how to connect these subjects and how these ones serve my future job. Now I understand better. Thank you very much"
426,"Give the functional experts (supplier analysts) a self-explanatory BI solution (Tableau/Power BI/ Spotfire, Qlik). Then, centralize the storage of data on a SQL server or Access Database. ETL performed by an Admin. There is no need to complicate. And increase the cost/risk/and reduce the effectiveness of a solution. <br><br><br>The functional experts know how to analyze their data. It‚Äôs not the job of programming or self-appointed data scientist. But instead, the technology department performs the ETL function and corrects when the analysts find dirty data."
427,"Awesome insights for someone like me trying to figure out the data world and it&#39;s tools, thanks"
428,"I work in gov&#39;t and excel is the go to and if I were to make other departments use SQL instead of excel it would be chaos, because no one uses sql at work or knows it but me. So, I&#39;m surprised by at least the point made in the video around <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TBwY4VjLX8&amp;t=4m28s"">4:28</a>. Honestly though most departments in my agency don&#39;t work with large enough data to really use anything else, so excel makes sense and around here and no one does anything fancy either. Crazy now that I think about it but I suppose you don&#39;t really need to do anything crazy with simple data other than add/multiply and avg."
429,Have you ever used Airtable? If so what are your thoughts on it?
430,I am having the same problem with excel. I want to move on to SQL for its limitations even though is a great tool. YOu are doing great content! Thank you!!!!
431,Some of the challenges you mentioned could be alleviated using validated excel files (using something like eInfoTree software by Cimcon)
432,Great video as usual mate.
433,"i struggle with the transition to databases. Working for a large company where everyone just knows Excel, there are data warehouses but there has to be an extremely well documented business need and process to go through with IT to even create tables there. I could always host the database on my local machine, but then my co-workers wouldn&#39;t be able to access them. Tried databases in the cloud environments (Azure, AWS, GCP) but once again, big company requires absolute business need to even create access to these tools. <br><br>Thus, we&#39;re just stuck using Excel as a &#39;database&#39; to connect to consumption tools like Power BI and Tableau. It&#39;s so painful to create this type of change as just an analyst in a large organization."
434,I remember a university project. I pissed an entire class off. We were doing a class wide project (only like 6 or so students). Everyone did their data cleaning and manipulation in excel. I wrote an entire small Java program to do everything for me that way I could do it all again fairly quickly if the rules of the project needed to change. Turns out the data contained several null values which excel would hide. Meanwhile my program was crashing because of the null values. Three months in and I made the entire class start over because I did something different.
435,Dude did you work with Dr Isratael?!!
436,"Me who uses Excel to do basic math instead of the calculator: &quot;What do you mean, everything?&quot;"
437,"To be honest, if performance is a concern you should consider using Julia instead of Python."
438,"Hello Luke,<br>First of all, I want to thank you for all of your videos. They&#39;re great. I&#39;m just finishing my degree title in Economics and I want to keep adding some knowledge to my CV. I think Analytics-related stuff is great. <br>A lot of people (and specially here in Argentina) says that a Excel course is a must in everyones carreer. So, as a way to start the path of Data Analytics learning... do you know a course in Excel to be recommended?<br>Thank you!"
439,"Luke‚Äôs panda fan club, where u at? üôãüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"

Now that being said I did take an introductory level 3-credit Python course in the spring semester back in college last year (we even had to do a program to design an obstacle free-path using Matplotlib and Numpy things like that). So that&#39;s my background with Python.<br>If I enroll in the Google Certificate, what course would you recommend for me if wanted to learn data analytics in Python side-by-side?"

530,Very informative content. This is exactly what I was looking for. Thank you.
531,"Hey Luke!<br><br>I am sort of perplexed when it comes to choosing either of these‚Ä¶ I have just finished the first course on the IBM certificate, but upon seeing several different comparisons with the Google certificate, I honestly don‚Äôt know what to do.   <br><br>Which one would recommend for someone that‚Äôs just trying to use a very important field (Data Science) as a compliment to a <a href=""http://b.sc/M.Sc"">B.Sc/M.Sc</a> within Business&amp;Economics/Innovation &amp; Industrial Management and why? Hence, not seeking a career strictly within data science. Also, FYI, I live in the EU, not the US (good to know since one main component of googles certificate, is it‚Äôs hub of American companies)"
532,"Is this for beginner, i mean for someone who don&#39;t know anything about or zero knowledge about all ?"
533,In a lot of your videos you mention Excel is the number 1 requested skill/tech for data analysts in job postings. Do you think it matters that Google teaches Google Sheets over Excel. I know they are similar but Excel seems more advance. So do you think this is a concern?

542,one query i have is - better to learn data analytics or data science courses for my own businesses or better to hire/consult a professional?<br>my businesses being<br>a) marketing and tax consultant<br>b) startup app company
543,I am from India and I&#39;m undergraduate can I take this course to get into the data analyst jobs in india
544,Totally agree with you mate. ü§ù<br><br>The Google certification looks really good as you have the benefit of 130 companies that hire you by having it. And thats probably only the start. Who knows what comes later in future.
545,"Hi luke, is it a good opportunity to take this certification course without any prior knowledge. I am from a medical background. please let me know. Thanks."
546,"I have a BS in Math (Stats, emphasis) but haven&#39;t done any work in the field (or any higher math at all) since graduating in 2015. I started the Google Analytics cert today."
547,"Well Done, oh Air Force Rules"
548,Does this course helps to land a job in finance ? Ty
549,is there any free course for that from any big university
550,"Thanks so much for your videos, Luke! I&#39;m looking to change my career so this is very useful. Subbed üëç"
551,"I have to agree, I have a BS in another field and you end up with more fluff,  other than more theory you could use. Not saying it isn&#39;t nice to have."
552,"I think It will be criticall having this kind of certifications from a titan as Google, the world move foward and as Facebook , Google is around the world so the opportunities will increase of few years, I am currently studying maritime engeneering, but i am off right now while covid, maybe for 1 year more, so learning this while i complement my studies on Udemy (There are paid courses that the owners give them to us for free, using coupon) so there is hope.<br><br>PD: speacially for me, I want to go out of my country Venezuela"
553,Am an MCA postgraduate...but I have no experience in IT...so can I do it?
554,You said that your university made you take some certifications in order to gain knowledge. Can you let me know what some of those certifications might be?
555,Is it worth to doing this Google data analytics certificates for indians as of now?
556,What‚Äôs your opinion on Thinkful? I‚Äôve been seeing ads on social media about them offering certificates in data analytics
557,"Hi Luke, now this course is not for free."
558,"What if you already have a BS, MS in Aerospace Engineering, you are working towards your PhD and most of your industry and academic experience is in Modeling and Simulations Eng. I‚Äôm trying to add a big ML component to my PhD research, however, would you recommend to do a certification?"
559,"CORRECTION: Google is estimating the time commitment to be 10 hours per WEEK, NOT per DAY like I said in the video ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è üòÇ Apparently I didn&#39;t have enough coffee before making this video."
560,Which job  I get after completing this course?
561,What if I already have Database Design and Data Analytics certificates from my university...? Is it still worth it?
562,I love this!!!
563,I&#39;m a diploma holder in electronics and communication can this cert be useful for me??
564,"If anyone is not able to pay after 1 month, then what?<br>Can he start later, for the remaining course..."
565,Is this usefull for an economics bachlor ?
566,No one have gotten a job after completing any of these google courses. I found that strange. I just finished and I am going to be applying for jobs soon.
567,"Thank you for the video. When you said 10 Hours per day in <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmLPS6FBbac&amp;t=1m55s"">1:55</a> I was shocked :D. Thank god its 10 Hours/week. Kind regards."
568,Can I become data analyst as I am diploma engineers with 8 yrs of industrial experience
569,Hay luke. I am trying to apply for financial add but my request not procceding kindly guide me.
570,Hy luke! Every time i fill financial aid application it bounce back and not procedding even filling all the boxes in the form but didn&#39;t work please assisst me. Thank&#39;s
571,"Very informative video. <br>I read some of the comments, and although these are certificates are for entry level positions, do you think they would be enough for someone looking for a change in careers, without a tech background professional and in academics?"
572,How do I connect am interested can I get a scholarship
573,"I have a laptop of ,32 bit , SQL is not working, jupyter in not working"
574,I am in course 2 and have to listen on x2 or else I get distracted
575,"Can someone above 40 learn this or this is just for younger guys. Furthermore, can data analysts integrate what they learned and possibly do analysis jobs as well as senior positions within the organization.<br><br>Thanks<br>By the way you said 10 hours a day but it is 10 hours a week."
576,"Taking the course right now. Excited to change careers after sales and get something more stable, more business tech. Let&#39;s go 2022!!"
577,Do you need AA degree to even start thinking about becoming a data analyst or can you just get these certifications and wing it?
578,Hi I am a CSE 1st year undergrad from India and I wanna know if this course is worth doing at such a young age?
579,"Second time watching, this humor is kinda advance for me to comprehend."
580,üî•üî•üî• pure comedic genius. I get so much value from your videos but this is now my fav!
581,Lol I do the coding tests for data scientists and no phds have been asked in for an interview.  Those coming from the analyst side aren‚Äôt any better. Lol.
582,"About the recursion, I am still remember when I learn and study about it in Data Structure and Discrete Mathematics course üòÇ"

594,"I don&#39;t know why I watched this, I&#39;m a physics and mathematics student. I guess I just like seeing how similar careers in other fields think of each other since there is a similar friendly rivalry between physicists and mathematicians."

601,"When I used to be a computer science student, I had a macbook pro. The biggest problem was around  Java version and operating system version. I needed the last java version because my homework needed arraylist so I needed to add the new os version in order to use the last Java version. I don‚Äôt judge but my Ada program compile without any problem after over 20 years. If I make a big projet, this is a pc on linux with c++. Too much problem after five years with these tools"
602,"Hi Luke,I want buy macbook for data science.I use Tableau,ML tool,python and R.I don‚Äôt know should buy macbook pro 16 inch intel or macbook pro 13m1 16gb ram.Can you help me option for me?"
603,"+Luke Barousse Hi, nice video. Btw do you know most machine learning desktops and servers run Linux directly instead of running Linux inside Windows or using Linux inside macOS? This provides access to amazing developer tools, amazing shell, direct access to hardware and Linux is just better for ml"
604,"It&#39;s so funny how this video laid out everything so clearly with a conclusion and a explicit recommendation, but there are still so many people asking in the comments if Luke would recommend M1 over PC... That really shows how much people just love apple.<br><br>If you are very used to using one OS for ML/DL work, would you say it&#39;s harder to switch entirely from windows to mac or from mac to windows? (hopefully my question makes sense...)"
605,Hi! Can you do a video on using the samsung book pro for data science? Please.
606,"Y&#39;all need to use Linux for data science, if you want to transition to ML engineering eventually."
607,Thank you <br>Just into R/SQL<br>Decided to pick up a Lenovo laptop <br>I feel like 16GB ram is better than M1 8B
608,Hi need suggestion is 8gb mac book Air is ok to use for data science and ml if not what wd u suggest
609,"LOL, many people felt so proud of owning a Mac... but not always better"
610,"If I&#39;m correct git bash works with Linux commands, based on my use so is the best alternative for Windows users wanting to use a terminal. Cygwin has a wider use but I found it less friendly!"
611,"After 8 months of  improvements and the new MacBooks Pro with M1 max, did you still recommend windows?"
612,"Hi Luke, it&#39;s bout 7 months after you make videos related to M1 Macbook for Data Science, there are compatible issues for packages back in time, will you cover the updates in the new video, please? üôèüôè"
613,rofl excel - this guys workflow is based on MS guy tools i can&#39;t handle this
614,"Hey Luke, do you think the new Macbook Pros are good for Data Analysis beginners? I know this video is a few months old so I was wondering if more apps are now supported on M1 Macs or is Windows still the better option?"
615,"As a new student, I will love to have Dell New XPS 13.. :&#39;) But it is sold at $2k here in Singapore while Mac is way cheaper.. T.T What a dilemma.."
616,thanks for the advice!! i really like your video great work!
617,Please stop using PC to mean Windows.

619,Which tool is your favorite? Tableau or Power BI?
620,is it  both tools are Freeware/open source?
621,How about ZOHO for data visualization?
622,"PBI kicks Tableaus butt. Tableau takes 20 times longer to make a dashboard and has MUCH LESS flexibility. DAX in PBI is much more powerful, it can use variables and create calculated tables. PBI also has a nicer data view which helps when doing exploratory data analysis. Tableau also queries the entire database every time you click something which is a total pain to stare at a data loading screen every time I want to add a column. PBI does this all in memory. Plus in Tableau you can&#39;t even change the name of a table column without a crazy work-around that is insane."
623,Tableau by a mile!
624,This is probably THE ONLY video on youtube which actually does meaningfully compare these two tools.
625,Zoho analytics
626,"If you know one, it is not hard to pick up the other. I have no problem hiring someone who can demonstrate proficiency with tableau, even though we use power BI."
627,Lol. As BI developer‚Ä¶ PBI is the way to go‚Ä¶ thank me later üòè
628,Thank you very muchüôè
629,Lukabrazzi
630,Both are good but I choose tableau to learn first after I get my first paycheck then I also learn Power BI<br> <br>I like your method<br>Learn it then use it
631,Love your content. So helpful
632,"Hi Luke, Thanks for your video. Its much helpful. I work for a media company- TV/Print/OOH/Online and looking for BI software.... we are stuck in deciding between TabClicks Vs. Tableau Vs. Power BI in terms of Coverage, Easiness and Pricing... Can you please suggest your best amongst all three.. Thanks for your kind help"
633,Subscribed. Good to see your information <br>I am getting into data analysis field üòÄ
634,"Microstrategy for the bulk, PowerBI for the rest."
635,You are a  great teacher!
636,"I&#39;ve only ever had experience building with Tableau. In my current job, we&#39;re a PowerBI company, but using the tool for prototyping (I don&#39;t do any technical work now). What i seem to come up against is that with PowerBI, calculated measures, especially with moderately sized datasets, seem to make PowerBI dashboards really slow, especially when you&#39;ve got a direct data connection to SQL Server! I never faced this issue with our previous Tableau/Redshift stack. The volume of data we&#39;re dealing with isn&#39;t gargantuan. Our team needs to go down the back-end route to solve certain issues because making a calculated measure would just make the dashboards slow. Am I being biased? Or is Tableau the more suitable tool in this situation?"
637,Curious why no one knows how to write good software at all.
638,All the points are explained very nicely and in detail. Thank you so much for this.
639,Love your healthy way of life and work
640,"I only recently decided to pursue a career in tech and specifically as a data analyst and I&#39;m looking to do it with an online bootcamp. Hence, I have been watching informative videos about the field and also real people&#39;s experiences like this one. And being an athlete my whole life, I&#39;d like to keep being able to train and stay active. However, some &quot;day in the life&quot; videos I have seen almost make that impossible. Watching your video, though, made me a little positive, hopeful, and inspired for the career! I do have some questions though. How did you get to make it like this, that you can do your work but still also give time for yourself and your hobbies? Did it take too long? Are you also self-employed or something? Hope you respond. Would love to see a video on it too! New here, but love your work man!!"
641,"to talk about my self , i started university with computer science then i really enjoyed maths so i switched to mathematics but i was not aware that higher level maths is just proofs which i dont like. i just like to deal with numbers. So now i am graduating with general science 3 years degree. can you advice what i can do after graduation in order to be a data analyst like a good pay data analyst. Or is it require to have a 4 year degree ? please let me know i am feeling very stuck right now"
642,not an offensive comment sorry
643,you have showed everything except data analysis..do you even work?? lol
644,This shows that it&#39;s all about organizing your time and following it up.
645,"How do I get this lifestyle? I sake up at 540am. Clock in at 555 am, sit there until 525pm working the entire time and then repeat."

648,"hello, i am a junior analyst and applied for 150 jobs. i will get a data analyst job soon and curious how my day will be :D. It is a lot of sport there, would be a dream if my company would help me with that. <br>Take care about data pipelines, building dashboards, meeting people, explain stuff to non-techs for 8 hours i expected. For a someone who never has seen and university its a weird feeling to spend the time so much differently is really nice."
649,Can anybody from another country work in this position?
650,"Looks like a really cool and fun routine, but I am wondering how many hours you are working every week? Looks like you were only working 5.5 hours that day"
651,Hey that really doesn&#39;t look even close to my day as a data analyst :-/ Either you are super-efficient in those 5 hours of work or I am doing everything wrong.
652,"My buddy and I do gravel riding before work, you can just add it to your calendar as a &quot;rolling work sync&quot;. Also, &quot;check email&quot;, don&#39;t you mean check Slack for an hour? ....also, I just joined a CrossFit gym haha"
653,"Hi, great and very informative video! It is about my boyfriend wnating to be a data scientist. Can i ask you some advice? He has a bachelor degree in business and a master degree in financial counseling. And he finished the 6 month data analyst course at flatiron boot camp before 2 months. the boot camp introduced him a company and the company suggested him a bussiness analyst position of 56000 dollars salary.

658,I have almost no idea what you actually do.
659,Congratulations on the 700 subs. Amazing video as usual.<br>Also please do a video on Jupyter notebook shortcuts or visualisation tutorials using not so complicated libraries like matplotlib
660,"Thanks Luke, this is informative. I am Data Scientist from India using 2020 13inch mac pro m1. Can you do a video on how to use dual monitor setup in mac?"
661,I don‚Äôt have a Mac computer
662,Can you do this same video but for Windows users?
663,what&#39;s theme are you using in iterm?
664,"Hey Luke, I have been watching your videos and till now, I was under the impression that you are a relatively famous Youtuber :D Best of luck and full support! I love this video."

667,See I told ya to cover general topics that many will find relatable to and here you are!! This video is about to blow up
668,Love all videos keep up the work <br>Early gang:
669,"Thanks! Great, simple method!"
670,Hi Luke! Which parallels desktop edition to purchase for beginner data analysts?
671,Thanks! Do you think the Mac gets slower because of Windows (Paralelles)?
672,"Hello, Luke! Been a while since you posted this video. Im wondering if you have had any issues working with Power BI during this time. Considering buying the M1 Max 32GB 16 version my self, so would been nice with and update on this. Thanks!"
673,"also have a mac with an M1 wanted to load it but it was there ,,To access this page,you need to be a member of the windows Insider program&#39;&#39; help"
674,"Hey Luke, Great Video thank you, will download Parallels tonight, Can I also use SQL Server Management Studio inside Windows on Parallels?"
675,Nice video! Do you keep your data inside the VM? What if you have a small SSD (256gb) and you need to work with an external SSD?
676,"Hey thanks for the video,  I am considering buying the new Macbook Pro with M1 Pro/Max but I must run Windows on it (because I must use Microsoft Office that runs on Windows, the Office for MacOS doesn&#39;t meet my work requirements which sucks). <br><br>Do you have any troubles using Microsoft Office for Windows that runs through Parallel, on your M1 Mac?<br><br>Thanks, honestly Microsoft Office is the only thing keeping me from pre-ordering the new Mac Pro with M1 Max chip now."
677,Thank you for this! How can we use SQL on MacOS?
678,"Super helpful video, now I can use PowerBI on my Mac"
679,Hi could you please confirm that Parrelel can run the SAP?<br><br>Awaiting response and thanks in advance.
680,"Hi there!  my old laptop is dead and I need an urgent one.  I thought about buying a Mac book air m1 with 16 gb RAM and 256 gb SSD for university use (taking advantage of the discount) and I am thinking about the possibility of doing a master in &quot;big data and business analytics&quot;.  It is not sure but I wanted to know if it would be ok for that and excel (data base), sql, power BI, access, sap. Or if I should buy a windows pc.  I saw that in a previous video of yours you had compared it to a Dell, but it is more expensive.  Thanks in advance.  üôè"
681,"Thanks a lol! I was thinking change my air with i3 for a M1 to emulate and use PBI. Thank, thanks"
682,Is parallels still available?
683,"Does autoCAD or revit work through parallels? I&#39;m starting school as a civil engineering student, and I would like to know if the m1 mac can run typical engineering programs that usually only work on windows?"
684,Hello sir i want to do power bi course.  Can you suggest me to have macbook m1 or any other laptop.
685,"Hi, Mr. Luke, first of all, congratulations of your channel. I&#39;d like to know. Does your mac is 8gb or 16gb ram? whats your opinion about use a Mac with parallels or a windows with 16ram to use power bi related about the performance to de PBI? Thank you!"
686,"hello sir i&#39;m from india,i am a student of data science so i want to buy a mac m1(8gb ram &amp; 256gb ssd) if i install UTM virtual machine after then i install windows 10 then can i use python,R,Tableu,Power Bi,Ms word ,Ms excel etc windows applications how will it be works ? <br>is UTM virtual machine will be installed on mac m1?"
687,Is Parallels good for your SSD? I had it open for 6 hours amd it has written 300GB of memory to SSD. I have an 8GB RAM and used a 4GB CPU/GPU on Parallels.
688,"Hi mate! How are you? I just bought my Dell xps13 9310 and the fun it‚Äôs making too much noise, I mean, a lot. Is that normal on Dell‚Äôs PC. Another question, how is your Mac M1 working with power BI and SQL ? Is it the same as windows on a pc? I was thinking about to replace my dell for a Mac to use this programs  with a big amount of data.<br>Thank youüëçüèª"
689,Like
690,you mean i just paid $280 for windows that will to work on Apple WTF
691,Are you using a 8gb MacBook air M1?
692,"Love mac hardware, want windows software üò≠"
693,Beersmith as an example!! Are you a homebrewer?
694,"People say Parallels work better now but something about allocating resources separately just to run a subpar Windows on a $3000 laptop doesn‚Äôt sit right with me. And the software is not even free. <br>I really miss Bootcamp, if I had known the new MB didn‚Äôt offer it I would‚Äôve not bought it."
695,Pure gold. Thanks my dude. You got my sub!
696,"Luke, awesome video overview especially for someone who&#39;s trying to understand how to launch Parallells on Macbook. Now that v17 is available, they support Windows 11 now on Macbook, which is awesome!"
697,wait what about windows 365
698,So why not consider a one time purchase of a mini-pc for a couple of hundred bucks and remote into it.  One time expense.
699,"30 cents per hour doesn&#39;t seem like a lot, until you multiply that by (say) 12 hours per day, 20-30 days per month and it quickly becomes absurd. PLUS MS has said that they will NOT be supporting Windows on M1 Macs. Ever. So you&#39;ll be stuck paying $100 per month for Windows, forever. Unless you, you know, just buy a Windows laptop."
700,That‚Äôs putting garbage in your designer closet
701,"Does anyone know how to download parallels to an external hd? I am trying to play steam games that are windows based but even though I download to the external, it also downloads all gigs of memory to each game onto parallels which is on my Mac M1 hd. Very frustrating. M1 only has 256gig hd vs 2tb external. Please help!!! :)"
702,"Hi Luke,  Honestly love your content! Great detail and explained in a simple but effective way. luke I have one question is next year 2022 my joining my Master program in  Business analysis. my question is I&#39;m debating between Mac or Windows laptop do you suggest? I&#39;m so confused right now can you help me out ??"
703,Coincidentally; I want to install windows to work on POWER BI! ‚òª <br>Thank you.

706,Thank you so much! I explored crossover today and it doesn‚Äôt work. And I don‚Äôt want to pay 130+tax for getting a Parallel Desktop just for light use of some productivity apps on Windows. Amazon desktop seems to be a great option!
707,"In short, Apple sucks and I regret buying the new MacBook with M1. I&#39;ll never buy an Apple product again."
708,So would you recommend this for data science? or you would just recommend for a content creator role?
709,May i request how to install Power BI to  M1 Macbook pro? Please step by step.
710,‚ÄúAnd boom there you have it‚Äù. Immediately thought of Tipsy Bartender from a couple years back
711,It&#39;s my dream to have this setup at my home.
712,"Hey Luke, nice video! What is the stand you&#39;re using for the MacBook?"
713,"I really love your setup, but i have a question regarding the stand up desk where can I actually find one"
714,"Hello Luke! I would like to know more about extending 2 displays for M1 Mac. In the video, I saw that you used one Starlink hub USB 3.0 to HDMI (I&#39;m clear with it). But for another display, you used another hub and connect to this display through the HDMI (or DP) port of this hub? Please correct me if I was wrong because I heard that this kind of setup will make them duplicated and finally, M1 will export to one external display only."
715,"Hi Luke! Would you care to explain your choice of monitors, specs, and why you prefer two side-by-side instead of an ultra wide? Thanks!"
716,Does your KVM switch allow you to hook up your Mac mouse/keyboard? Do I need anything special to do this?
717,"Hi, thank you for the video.  Would you also share the information for the stand that combines the two monitors?"
718,At this point can we just all admit that the reason we prefer dual monitor setups is so that we have a dedicated screen for Stack Overflow?
719,You ever thought about putting a panel equal to the lowest height you&#39;d lower your desk to cover up the cables?
720,Very helpful. Which monitors do you use?
721,Why don&#39;t you get a pet dog !!! Just saying üòÇ
722,"Great content, Luke. Keep it up. Was wondering, with multiple monitors in your setup, if you do anything to protect your face/eyes from monitor light? Is it a concern?"
723,Nice set-up!!! How did you attach those Creative Pebble speakers to the monitors?
724,Great video! Just subscribed. I was wondering what KVM switch you‚Äôre using as I have a similar setup. Thanks mate. üëçüòä

728,Setup of the bikes?
729,I would love to see an update of this video and maybe a tutorial on how to setup two separate environments (rosetta and natively) on a m1 mac
730,Thanks Luke. Hello from Brazil
731,Luke I‚Äôve been missing your videos! Can‚Äôt wait for you to compare the 16inch base MacBook with the new M1 Mac‚Äôs!
732,"Hi Luke, will you test the upcoming new MacBook air and MacBook pro? I still can&#39;t make up my mind to wait for new one or get the M1 instead."
733,Any updates in package support?
734,"Will the python from different soures be different? For example, the python installed by conda and python installed by brew, or by macos terminal directly."
735,Is 8 gb ram enough?
736,Do you know if the MacBook Air 8GB is sufficient to build iOS/iPadOS apps? Should I just get the MacBook Pro to take advantage of the fan to keep the CPU cooled down for long sessions?
737,Can i use flask by installing native python 3.9 natively on m1 ?
738,Good videos!<br>Have you any information of how STATA works on apple M1?<br>Thanks a lot!
739,"wish all developing tools get optimized soon ..  ‚Äã @Luke Barousse  what screen(monitor), keyboard, and mouse combo you use in the video"
740,thanks for sharing! Great to see this kind of testing instead of numerous video editing/benchmark reviews
741,import timeit<br><br>a = 1<br><br>while a &lt; 100000 :<br>    a+= 1<br>    print(a)<br><br>print (timeit.default_timer())<br><br>does this count as the same loop test ?
742,I am a new Mac user and windows python user can you show me or make a video to show how you get python to run without Rosanna thank you
743,Keep at it :)
744,"Hey Luke, can we get your email for contacting regarding freelance data science job from offshore"
745,nice job!
746,"Nice content, looking forward to more .."
747,"super love. this result is consistent with mine, which runs time series for algo-trading by using pandas and statsmodels. Thank you Luke"
748,Good content..!!! Can u also check  Visual Studio performance..
749,"If you&#39;re curious on how the M1 Mac compares to an Intel Mac check out this video:  <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyPm2fOyS7Y"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyPm2fOyS7Y</a>"
750,"Is this video of an actual software developer elaborating on whether or not buy an m1 mac based on his experience of daily usage instead of doing benchmarks and video editing ? Holy smokes wish there were more people like you, thx for the review man"
751,thank you very much that was very informative !
752,"People need to understad that the system will use the ram if it is available there. I have 32gb ram on my windows machine and 16 is utilized. All I am using is browser and some office applications, and pdf. I bought 8gb Macbook Air and it uses less than 8 gb because that&#39;s what the system is given. I can run vs code, run some code, have some office programs<br><br>Having said that,16gb will make your computer future proof. I think 16 should already be the norm. The mobile phones have 6 gb ram nowadays. I am planning to keep my computer for next 3 years,, I think I will manage."
753,"Thank you so much Luke, you really helped me make my choice"
754,"Thank you, Luke! How can I run windows version of MS Excel and Power BI on MBA M1? I need to use power query and it looks like it‚Äôs not available on Mac‚Äôs version of Excel."

757,thanks bro this helped me decide between the two
758,Would MacBook Pro 13&#39; will be enough for students who are studying data science in college?
759,"Hi, thanks for the video. I&#39;ve been wondering - if I purchase the air and upgrade to the 16GB RAM, won&#39;t there be a bottlenecking issue (will the available RAM actually be less than 16GB)?"
760,Could you please tell me that should I go for MB air (16/512) 8 core GPU or MB pro (16/256). I am beginner in programming and also I&#39;m gonna use it for photo editing and mild video editing.
761,"Luke.. you should teach other YouTubers how to respect own viewers. I‚Äôm shocked for how many questions you answered, big respect and no ego! ü§ù"

765,"You&#39;re just reading documentation on video,lol"
766,Tell me please. Did I understand correctly that 8 gigabytes will not be enough to work comfortably with 5-10 tabs in Google Chrome + PyCharm?<br><br>ps. I want buy Mac Mini
767,"Hi, I will work with analysis of data, python, .NET/C#, also basic statistics and data manipulation, I usually have a lot of tabs open, using android studio, visual code, but i don&#39;t know which one to choose, can you help me please?"
768,"What about the high SSD writes?  I‚Äôve been waiting until there‚Äôs a 32gb RAM option because of the projected 2 to 3 year lifespan of the SSD.   My logic was less RAM, more swap, more RAM, less swap used."
769,"I love it! Yes, 1-2 minutes would be perfect."
770,"You were not kidding about &quot;shorts&quot; :xP , it is way too short. Please make it like 1-2 mins atleast so that its easier to follow"

773,"Hey Luke ! This video is really helpful. I have a question though. How good is the MAC when it comes to Pyhton Deep Learning such as Image classification, neural networks, etc. ?"
774,Hello there Mr Barousse.<br>I wanna order a new MacBook with m1 chip. But it&#39;s important for me that I can run Bioinformatics programs specifically GROMACS. Could you please help me and check out that Can I run GROMACS on m1 MacBook?<br>Best regards
775,Thanks for the video. Any updates on Tableu and Power BI compatibility with the M1? I‚Äôm looking to get on for an MSBA starting in January

778,"CE here, just want to clarify‚Ä¶ silicon  is pronounced sili-Kin. Sili-Cone is a rubber like plastic.  Silicon vs silicone."
779,"I am curious if this suggestion has changed at all and what, if any, is changed with the new M1X and the ability to have more than 16GB of RAM in the MacBook Pro now.   My son is in college and he is studying data science and has had a MacBook Pro (Intel) that is around 6 years old and I was debating giving him my 16&quot; Intel MacBook Pro from last year or getting him another computer.   I look at the current AMD/Intel Microsoft Windows laptops but honestly they seem horrible when compared to the new M1X laptops.   I am just curious how significant running Microsoft Windows still is for a Data Scientist in todays world."
780,I wonder how it compares to an i9 intel mb pro?
781,"Thank you so much for your Content.<br>I‚Äôm beginner of data science course . <br>How do you think MAC M1 suitable for Data science ? <br>( deep learning , machine learning )"
782,"I pretty enjoy working on the M1 MacBook Pro but I also hate it because the Mac version Excel doesn&#39;t come with the POWER SUITS (query/pivot/map). <br>On the other hand, I like to use XLWINGS to automate some procedures with Python. Due to the fact that different api was called on Windows PC and Mac OS (win32 versus appscript), the way you call each method and attribute are also different. XLWINGS official documentation doesn‚Äôt provide a complete tutorial on how to use XLWINGS on Mac OS. <br>Both of these reasons made me turn back to Windows PC."
783,"I‚Äôm data engineer. So I use tools for data viz, data analysis(python, scala) and etc. do u think it‚Äôs okay to buy macbook pro m1? Can m1 handle it?"
784,"Hey Luke..great review..<br>I just want to know which would be the best option for data science .all the software like tableu ,R ,apache spark etc all which are used to learn data science.<br>M1 or intel i5 or ryzen 7"
785,"I feel like lack of M1 support for Python, Tableau, Power BI, and R Studio makes this not ideal.  Perhaps I don‚Äôt understand clearly how Resetto works by mimic-ing an intel chip, but that seems like there‚Äôs some virtualization going on which could be another layer of complexity."
786,you can use parallels on M1 machines to run vm machines and adopt windows features on your research

788,"Hi Luke, thanks for uploading this informative video. In terms of some libraries used in python but do not work properly on m1 MacBook. Do you have any issues installing scipy or seaborn under python apple silicon? Thanks."
789,"This right here. THIS is THE video I was looking for and I absolutely needed.<br>I‚Äôm currently an undergraduate Finance student, and I‚Äôd also love to learn basics to start diving into Fintech world and build a career. Who knows.<br>I read a lot of negative opinions about the performance of Excel on M1 but no proof. In the end I‚Äôm just a beginner. I have trust in what I have just witnessed in this video, perform basic operations and functions with Excel program and light coding is what I need at the moment.<br>The main problem I encounter too often with Windows laptops is the pairing with all my Apple devices ‚Äì what a pity. Maybe I‚Äôll get one in the future for work, like you did. But for my usage and level, I guess I‚Äôll just need the bare minimum.<br>This video was vital for my definitive choice.<br>I‚Äôll get the MacBook.<br><br>I‚Äôve also just started to give a look at your YT channel.

824,Super helpful!
825,2nd time subscribing for some reason.
826,"This is a well made tutorial. I liked the presentation very much.<br>I found that when trying to create a list with numbers from 1-100 using the range function, the correct expression would be range(1,101) since the last number i.e. 101 is not included.¬†<br>range(100) would give you a list from 0 to 99 only, i.e. ¬†0,1,2,3,4,5.....95,96,97,98,99"
827,"Wow, well done I am going through a lot of Python tutorials but believe me your way of teaching is far better than all of them. Thanks a lot please keep making these tutorials you are doing great job."
828,Beautifully done!
829,"Good content, are you planning for pandas and numpy videos?"
830,"Hello Luke, when I execute the commands to obtain the list of all lines (in your tutorial you run those command at minute  <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnfbVOt9IR0&amp;t=19m35s"">19:35</a>), unfortunately the first line that comes out is from episode 3 (&quot;Good luck.

835,I didn&#39;t get it when you assigned the previous_item to the item. Can you share how you defined previous_item
836,Wondering what interface you&#39;re using? It says Jupyter server but it doesnt &#39;look&#39; like JupyterNotebook or JupyterLab.
837,this helps! very nicely explained. thank you!
838,Thanks for sharing.
839,"I&#39;m so glad I ran into your videos, your methodology is great, I&#39;m learning a lot and it&#39;s making me more sure about entering this field! Thanks a lot Luke!"
840,"Hello Luke, thanks for this tutorial...The ability that you have in explaining these concepts is pure talent! I have one question regarding the &quot;Application&quot; part: when I created my code and then I compared it to your solution, I noticed that I didn&#39;t put the first &quot;else:&quot; (the one under the &quot;Re-enter the name&quot; line), while you have put that &quot;else&quot; instead. Despite this my code worked perfectly. So my question is: is it necessary to put that &quot;else&quot;, or is it rather a matter of &quot;making the code as beautiful, clear and tidy as possible&quot;? Thanks in advance! Regards"
841,good job
842,thanks amigo
843,"I followed through your tutorial while being on jupyter : in <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCN_GRRAoF8&amp;t=9m45s"">9:45</a> it gave me a syntax warning when i wrote ; 1 is 1 !!"

847,Hey fellow data nerd! Helpful video.
848,Thanks for making these videos they&#39;re really helpful to beginners.
849,"THANK YOU SO MUCH. YOU ARE APPRECIATED ALL OVER THE WORLD! GREETINGS. &quot;Funny&quot; thing: it took me more than two days to complete this tutorial, because I COPIED ALL THE CODES BY MYSELF. I realized what the material was for only at the moment of the exercises, where I told myself: &quot;No, there must be a solution for this long code with all the names of the actors who had a line&quot; LOL. But I don&#39;t regret it at all, because being new to Python I learned a lot by coding by myself!!!  THANK YOU SO MUCH LUKE...MARRY ME"
850,This video is fantastic totally a great idea to be included in a portfolio

863,No idea on how this vid has so low views. Fantastic work
864,Thank You fr this <br>Its really helpful ‚úåüèª
865,I just want to learn this for the office thing
866,This is the best playlist in all YouTube
867,"i will watch all ads, thanks for sharing your kowledge."
868,Great stuff taught in comprehensible way. I want your advice that how to actually retain Pandas or SQL syntax. Should I go through lectures and practice along with it. Or just finish entire module and then take up projects. Since there are too many commands and its really difficult to recall them all the time. I end up wasting time chunk of time in correcting syntax to get desired result. Really difficult to recall exact command/syntax unless going back and forth to documentation. Appreciate your assistance.
869,thans really hellpful
870,I. M from sudan do think can i watch this curse and i Learning from it. S
871,That sunburn though :P<br>Great video Luke. Keep it up!
872,"Thanks for creating this, looking forward to following along!"
873,"All I can say is thank God for these  series of videos. But I honestly can&#39;t believe that well into the 21st century, you can&#39;t just open the program and start coding.  It&#39;s like having to walk 5 miles to draw water from a well to take home just to make a cup of tea. Anyway, really appreciate the content, many thanks."
874,"Hi Luke! I am used to work with R and markdown which has similar code cells and the output below them, however, in R+markdown I can run just the line where my cursor is on even if it is in a code cell using CMD + Enter, instead of the whole code cell. Is there some way I can do that in Jupyter notebooks? I searched a bit and someone suggested I should install a debugger since that is what it is called but I still have no luck in doing this.<br><br>Interesting videos, keep up the good work!"
875,"thanks for the information, really helpful"
876,LIKE
877,what about Spyder?
878,Thanks very useful video!
879,this video is gold!! Thank you!!!
880,Why do you suggest creating a new environment for each new project? Does that mean that you have to install special packages again in that new env?
881,Cool - thanks!
882,When i import pandas i always get an error that the module is not recognized.. I want to note that i already installed anaconda and the pandas module but i get the same error. I would appreciate a lot some help
883,"great series, really helped me understand how to use virtual environments with anaconda and how to use jupyter notebooks within VSCode. Loved the visuals as well"
884,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwlySU7Hjg&amp;t=15m32s"">15:32</a> is that control + option + N on Mac?"
885,"I have a question, when I use jupyter the syntax colours are like dark blue for keywords and operators, dark red for strings,etc. Which is undreadable in dark mode, how can I fix that."

894,like
895,"Hello Luke, I am new to programing and want to expand my knowledge. I have followed your previous vids and installed everything correctly. Until this vid. My terminal looks different as you are using a mac. In the previous vids you showed how to do both platforms. Can you please explain how to do it for win 10. I would try to install &quot;conda instal numpy==/1.17&quot; with no luck in the python terminal. the terminal I am using doesn&#39;t generate the &quot;$&quot; symbol for me or have the different colors.

897,"Hey Luke, great videos<br><br>My Terminal looks different than yours (did the same as you regarding installation etc.) but you terminal says 2:python, whereas i can only choose powershell og cmd, how do i get the same option as you, for instance my terminal doesn&#39;t show which virtual environment i am in if i use Powershell or if it is cmd it shows which virtual environment but i can&#39;t use clear for example. <br><br>Is there anyway i can make it like yours?<br><br>Kind regards <br>Jens"
898,thank you best video I&#39;ve seen so far to explain why and how to set up virtual environment
899,The blue popup information you create is very distracting. Otherwise a great video!
900,"Hi Luke. I&#39;m a beginner in this world of programming languages and Data World and your videos are helping me a lot! but i&#39;m having a huge troubles with the virtual environments . I did every single step you did in your videos of installing python, anaconda and VS code. everything seems to be perfect. I write the code to create the new environment and it runs well but... when I try to activate it does nothing. literally  nothing. Don&#39;t put error, does not activate it and I don&#39;t know what to do now"

902,"Very neat explanation, subscribed!"
903,"Hey Luke please give me a solution for this, I am using Windows 10<br>from numpy.core._multiarray_umath import (<br>ImportError: DLL load failed: The specified module could not be found."
904,"This video series was a great help, very much appreciated!"
905,luke i am stuck here i can all i am seeing here is this conda.io.activation can u help
906,"Hi Luke¬†Thanks for your great content on youtube. Unfortunately, I have still e problem with the module numpy. I follow your instructions very carefully but if it comes to run the file_<a href=""http://2.py/"">2.py</a> which has includes the numpy command, it seems ¬†hat the venv can‚Äôt find such one. Curiously if I change the interpreter in VsCode to base, it all works without any errors. However, I can‚Äôt fix the problem if I run the code in the venv1. It occurs this Error: ModuleNotFoundError: No module named &#39;numpy&#39;.¬†It would be great if you or anyone else could help me to fix it.¬†Thanks in advance"
907,Wow. The explanation is very clear !! Thanks.
908,"clearly in the topics will have, also, this is what I want! Thanks."
909,"Luke, this series is so awesome. Been trying to figure out how best to setup anaconda and virtual environments and this is by far the clearest and best guide. I just had two quick Qs: 1) in your terminal and the .py files stuff pops up so you can autocomplete what you are typing; how do I set that up? 2) My terminal is the power shell whereas yours has the environment in parentheses and the dollar sign at the end; how do I get that setup? Thanks again for these amazing videos!"
910,"Great Job Luke. I&#39;ve been following this playlist and so far its going great. Just one ques though, math code works fine. But, numpy is not working for me. when I tried installing it the output came &#39;already installed&#39;"
911,"Hi, I asked a question on another post, but then I came here. So, I downloaded anaconda on my Mac, but do I need to add a conda extension to my VS code?"
912,Amazing work Luke. All you videos have excellent explanation with perfect visualization. Keep on going (y)
913,hi Jupyter notebook keybord shortcuts won&#39;t work in Vscode
914,Super excited with your content. Could you please tell me the tools to create YouTube content
915,I have installed anaconda &amp; python following your last 3 videos. However the &quot;Python: Create New Blank Jupyter Notebook&quot; option is not showing in the VS Code search bar. May i know what could be the problem? Thanks
916,‚Äã @Luke Barousse  .. I am here.. and a change I use native Python  Interpreter..  btw Thanks.
917,"Luke, kindly explain. what if you have already installed python but did not add it to the cmd environments path which means you cannot run python from the cmd. Besides what happens if the jupyter notebook code you run doesn&#39;t work as I am experiencing. What could be the reason?"
918,"Luke, would be great if you create a series or a video about integration with github and building portfolios for beginners. Your videos are great!"
919,"Bro I installed vs code in linux , and have installed modules like flask,pandas, playsound,,, but every time I run code in vs it gives me import error: module not found,,, please help"
920,Nice tan :-D
921,Amazing videos
922,Thanks for your incredible video it just help me conclude what is the use of anaconda
923,please stop with those pssshhh intros it actually makes me insane! Really love this series and your content though so thank you so much for the great videos :)
924,"Hi Luke, I still don&#39;t really understand the pros and cons of using text editors and IDE. I don&#39;t see why we even bother to use text editor when IDE is just like text editor but more convenient, yet a lot of people still use text editor. Why do you think is that?"
925,These video series are great. Thanks a lot Luke!

934,"Hi Luke, your amazing tutorials have made my day because they are so informative and to the point, well done!! Would you also consider to make a bonus part of how to properly clean, pivot, map data using Tableau prep or using any other tools you would recommend (but since this is a Tableau module, so would an advance tutorial in Tableau prep be a good idea)? as people always have to clean their data before analyzing and beginners like me may want to see how the best tools can do the job (More tricky examples is much appreciated haha). So excited to watch all of your other videos and especially your educative contents have all become one of my daily routine to learn as much as I can before I formally start my continuing studies about data analytics in college in September."

939,Awesome series with all necessary content about Tableau! Easy to follow for beginners!Thank you so much!
940,Amazing content.
941,Just wanted to say that I&#39;ve been working through this whole series and these are all really great. I&#39;ve gone through other Tableau courses that were much longer and not nearly as useful. Thank you!

Once you understand trend lines, reference lines are super simple to create and you just utilize a value (such as a parameter) to mark a line on your visual.  Try both out!"
944,"is there a way to make the average line a function of the value? e.g the value i plotted includes negative values, but i want the average line to show the average of its absolute value."

960,what up nerds lmao that was great
961,Hey Luke! Thanks for the video. Are you able to connect to sheets in a shared folder on Google drive or only to sheets in your own folder?
962,How can i use two data sets independently in a tableau...(dont want to create any join)
963,"Hey Luke, wonderful vid! I have an issue though. Say I have two separate worksheets. I can&#39;t combine them because then I&#39;ll get the error: &quot;file is too large to be exported&quot;. How do I union these two separate worksheets (as in, how do I join two tables with different connections)?"
964,What do you use to clean your data on google sheets?

969,"When doctors or therapist challenge the patients &quot;i am trans and have gender dysphoria&quot; narrative, the patient immediately quits and changes to another doctor or therapist who affirm to their believes or delusion. These doctors and therapists also get labelled as a bigots and transphobics by the patient and the woke crowd with threats of losing their jobs. These patients come very convinced that they are trans, is extremely stubborn and NEVER listen to anyone that dont affirm to their delusions. Noone talks about this. Take responsibility for your own decisions, convictions and actions. Stop shifting the blame onto others especially the medical personnels."
970,Crazy people
971,"Homophobia is as endemic in modern trans activism, as misogyny. Today trans rights are a men&#39;s sex rights group."
972,"Glad to see the BBC presenting such a challenging report in this context however it has also been complicit in actively promoting trans ideology to children and young people.<br>This issue has raised concerns within quite possibly the wokest profession imaginable, that of social work and there is now an organisation titled the Evidence Based Social Work Alliance (acronym dot org). I think we might&#39;ve crested this appaling wave for young people."
973,The destruction of humanity
974,"Bbc, why don‚Äôt you leave the comments open on other videos about this topic"
975,"Okay, let‚Äôs just say something. Even if there isn‚Äôt  problem, we should talk about this, share studies etc. We need to stop with so many accusations of being a bigot or ‚Äúterf‚Äù, because they can be used to frame any questioning related to this topic  (e.g. what about kids pushed to transition because of homophobia, or because of a mental ‚Äúroot‚Äù problem), as an inherently hateful thing. We‚Äôre not trying to be hateful to trans youth, we‚Äôre trying to help them ."
976,"If puberty blockers can only be used by over 16s, what&#39;s the point?"
977,We need to speak up and out about this while I support people&#39;s personal reasons to trans I don&#39;t agree it should be allowed on kids or teens. If you speak out your branded a transphobe which I&#39;m not do what makes you happy but that has to be a mature choice. Forcing your kids to appease you own issues in wrong
978,Perversion of power and authority in the medical community. Talk about good and brave journalism. People fear for their livelihoods when speaking out on this.
979,The Tavistock Centre should be closed down and the parents pushing for their children to transition should be locked up for abuse!!
980,The whole idea of messing with children&#39;s bodies is sick
981,&quot;Professing to be wise they become fools&quot;. This are remnants of the enlightenment that gave us the world wars and justification for the enslavement of black people. It&#39;s apparently mind boggling absurdity finds its climax when this nation that stood by its principle choose to set up a clinic to change the sex of people within the most precarious age range in human development.
982,"It&#39;s strange how children can&#39;t legally consent to sex,can&#39;t vote, can&#39;t buy energy drinks, but they can legally consent to hormone blockers and cross sex hormones that PERMENANTLY alter your body."

984,"The reason...$$$$. I have a lot of gay friends and a gay daughter, but after years of experience I&#39;m quite sure that very few people who question their identity will actually be happier with a sex change treatment.

996,"Every single asylum seeker is here illegally, thanks to the rules put in place by the United Nations someone seeking asylum has to seek it in the first available safe nation. As they have to travel through the safety of Europe to get to us they are here illegally.  There are not enough jobs available for those of us born here to British heritage let alone those who do not even speak a single word of English.  I believe that the British Benefit System should only be conducted in English, Welsh, Scottish, Irish, Cornish, Gaelic, British Sign Language and Makaton. If you do not understand any of the ways in which people of the British Isles communicate then you do not qualify to use our benefits.  I also believe that an employer should have to prove that a job can only be performed by foreign labour to then be able to hire non native people. We have so many homeless veterans on the street unable to work because all the jobs are taken by foreigners.  I am not racist in any shape or form, I just think if you want to work and live here you respect and follow our rules, and not expect us to change our ways for you."

1013,"The absolute only update and/or conversation  should be about protecting the very small subset population of the most vulnerable,  susceptible people who should  take necessary precautions and allowing the virus to run its natural course.  Allowing the infection to  pass through the general healthy population, that effectively have almost a zero percent chance of serious infection, is the Only way to completely neutralize the viral virulence.  Prolonged isolation of the elderly or people in care homes is nothing less than inhumane and should be considered crimes against humanity.  <br><br>     Naturally acquired Herd immunity is not an objective opinion or hypothesis a theory a strategy or a debate, it is biological law that exists and occurs like gravity or the laws of thermodynamics whether anyone believes in it or not. <br><br> The strangest phenomenon to be witnessed in this century at such a colossal scale,  is &quot;Science Denialisim&quot;.  (refusal to accept and ultimately deny, (even at the highest level) established fundamental, empirical science and facts.) causing mass irrational fear fueled primarily by the hyper hysteria of the internet era. <br><br><br>     There has never in history been an effective  Cor/virus vaccine, caused by two fundamental factors, antigenic shift (mutation) and virulence dilution. In other words any vaccines that are being developed right now as we speak, are already dated and ineffective.  <br><br>       The high case counts with low casualty numbers are a normal predictable pattern of all Corona viral outbreaks. The virus has drastically weakened virulence from T-Cell antibody immune response to massive population infection spread and saturation, to the extent it becomes, to the vast majority, nothing more than another common cold like annoyance. <br><br>          Because the SARS-COV-2 virus is now at the epidemiological low level virulence classification, what is known in epidemiology as the pathogen endemic equilibrium phase. (viral stasis)  All future focus should be towards (MPIE) mass population immunization by exposure, (herd immunity) from the healthy population, as rapidly as possible in order to protect the most vulnerable health population.<br><br> Everyone must take the time to listen to this interview (and others) with prominent top scientists, with over 3,500 virologist, epidemiologist, scientists and infectious disease experts signing onto a Sweden approach, Barrington declaration. This many scientists signing on, is not surprising however considering it was the exact worldwide infectious disease policy that has been implemented for every pandemic for the past century. /    <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rz_Z7Gf1aRE"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rz_Z7Gf1aRE</a>             <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iC8NH1BNGz8"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iC8NH1BNGz8</a>                           <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTBIcGyR4lI"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTBIcGyR4lI</a>                  <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6LB2Rp44zA"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6LB2Rp44zA</a>                              <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vbB1IGDm3Y"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vbB1IGDm3Y</a>                     <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=013L9J7WhuU"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=013L9J7WhuU</a>"

1220,"‚ÄúStand back, and stand by‚Äù  For what?  The Proud Boys aren&#39;t deputized.  No state government has delegated any authority to them.  Don&#39;t fear these ass hats.  Their authority ends at their own individual property line just like any other U.S. citizen.   I suspect in the near future we are going to see multiple white supremacy groups try to become the enforcement arm of Donald Drumpf&#39;s Presidency.  When and if you see that, it is going to be time for every American patriot to don their masks like our enemy and fight back.  Do not be ashamed.  If you know your cause is true, if we must fight this fight once again, we must be stalwart and resolute in our conviction to honor our blessed Constitution.  I think the coming violence in the United States is a fight most of us have been trying to avoid.  And in that reluctance we have legitimized the traitors amongst us.   <br><br>     The people in Congress only have so much power.  Congress cannot protect you.  We must save ourselves.  I know these government officials and TV personalities seem so large in life on the big screen.  But they really have no more power than what we the citizenry are willing to get down in the trenches for.  Are you the type of American willing to die to save your country from fascists?  Are you anti fascist?   <br><br>     We are living on a thin line and there&#39;s no England anymore.   So stand back and stand by my fellow progressives, for now.

And though Tamil people do have free education, they are in certain instances subjugated to social inequality. Still stories like these show the youth is getting more benefits in education as we near the future. People who say sri Lanka has free 100% education need to take a closer look at what this theory does in practice."

1316,"Hoping someone can answer this question? In July Chris witty the chief medical officer stated in a parliamentary select committee hearing that the virus was already in retreat prior to the implementation of lockdown. The reason for this is that the case data in March and April Was incomplete due to a lack of testing therefore the most accurate data during the 1st wave of the pandemic was the data for deaths. The peak in deaths according to the ONS Was on a 8th April, studies show That on average it takes 3 weeks to die from  coronavirus after contracting it.  Therefore in order to find the true peak in the number of cases you would count back roughly 3 weeks from the peak in deaths That would take you to several days prior to the implementation of the lockdown. Also Add to this as outlined recently by sage lockdowns take at least 2 weeks to start reducing transmission.  So it is impossible to claim that the lockdown caused the peak in the number of infections,  as it would have had to have been implemented as early as the 7th of March (prior to the cheltnam festival and liverpool vs athletico).<br><br>The sage group  Has stated that lockdowns do not prevent Infections they merely push infections into the future and therefore lockdown measures do not  Prevent deaths they delay when they happen. the purpose of the lockdown measures is to slow transmission So hospitalizations dont Rise too quickly and overwhelm the NHS. <br><br> So if the peak in infections was prior to the implementation of lock down then the peak number of hospitalizations and deaths was not reduced by lock down either and As the nhs was never overwhelmed It would suffice to sayThat the lockdown was pointless as The nhs was never going to be overwhelmed.<br><br>Agree or disagree"

The quoted 1,000,000 deaths of people having had a positive result following a test for ‚ÄòA‚Äô virus and allegedly having died from exposure to the corona virus, is misleading since a high proportion died from an underlying cause‚Ä¶.Cancer, Heart disease, Liver or Kidney failure, old age, accidents, malaria, snake bites etc etc.<br><br>The quoted 41,000 who died in the UK having tested positive for ‚ÄòA‚Äô virus probably only included 20,000 who died from the annual flu. The quoted 33 million ‚Äòcases‚Äô quoted on the BBC are certainly greater than the annual 5 million ‚Äòcases‚Äô quoted in the article. However, the article only includes ‚Äòcases‚Äô of SEVERE illness. Inevitably with this insane panic causing millions to be ‚Äòtested‚Äô for ‚ÄòA‚Äô virus, an action which has reached pandemic levels, everyone who tests positive for ‚Äòany‚Äô virus will escalate previous annual statistics. Test increase, numbers testing positive escalate, but death rates continue to fall in areas historically past the peak of annual flu deaths.<br><br>We are NOT facing a pandemic! There will be a second ‚Äòwave‚Äô of ‚Äòflu‚Äô at the same time of the year at whatever latitude there is historically a peak!<br><br>Annual death rate in the UK is 9.413 per 1000 <a href=""https://www.macrotrends.net/countries/GBR/united-kingdom/death-rate"">https://www.macrotrends.net/countries/GBR/united-kingdom/death-rate</a> So with a population of 67,816,000 the total number of deaths per year is 638,352 or 1749 on average every day.<br><br>Get a grip UK government.

1424,"On Tuesday‚Äôs Mark Levin Show, Even in their reporting, the New York Times reports that President Trump has paid more than $24 million in taxes through the alternative minimum tax, not just $750. Joe Biden benefitted from tax laws that he passed in the senate to avoid payroll taxes like the Medicare tax. Joe Biden is more concerned with the President‚Äôs taxes than he is with your taxes."
1425,"Who is the bigger hypocrite.   President Trump, who underpaid his taxes by $750.00.   Or Old Joe Biden who used 16 Shell corporations to hide kickbacks, bribes, gifts, and embezzled money from the IRS Tax system to begin with?    Advantage President Trump who at least reported all his gains and losses to the IRS."

1548,"Mrs Guinsburg was a brilliant mind, a living legend. During her long life,  she&#39;s been through some hard stuff, but she never played  anything down,  she never wavered, she told the truth. She stood for human rights.The rights of all the American people. Regardless of who they are. In one word: She stood for justice.

1555,&quot;Trump nominates religious conservative&quot; that title doesn&#39;t sound biased at alllllllllll...
1556,"If Amy Barrett has any decency, she will withdraw from SC nomination and resign. To be installed by a crook, and a bunch of crooked Republicans enablers without batting an eyelid, I wonder if her loyalty lies with the USA or Putin?"
1557,"According to an October 6 Guardian article, Amy Coney Barret is a member of a religious group named People of Praise.  This is no normal branch of the Catholic Church... I encourage everyone to search YouTube and watch the video of a member who escaped this secretive organization and wrote a memoir about her experience.  She refers to them as a cult which requires lifetime vows.  They kidnapped her, micro managed her daily duties, and she had to go into the witness protection program after she escaped!  It‚Äôs inappropriate and very dangerous to have a member of such a controlling religion (the escaped victim refers to them as a cult) be part of the Supreme Court."
1558,she&#39;s already established that women&#39;s right to abortions wouldn&#39;t be changed and still the left is trying to attack her for being a white catholic who is apparently racist for having a black child. give me a break üôÑ

1679,"Hi i am are working on coronavirus from January 2020 when I come to know about this virus in dec 21/12/2019 from one of my Chinese female friend. We both collected too much data technically and non technically in both ways .In February only we understand the severity of this virus just because of it&#39;s mutancy, data which we collected till now is as good as  just like we predicted  future. initially in our research we found that propolis of Brazil having much better Ingredients Available which help for covid-19 patients for best treatment and after studying all the related subjects required to found some fruitful result. On 16/10/2020 we come across a theory of called &quot; five circle theory&quot; which if any human body doing he will never be cause any serious damage to cell the fundamental unit of life till antibodies not developed which are as follows .<br>1.10 minutes sunlight.<br>2.Daily use of ginger.<br>3.Four diets of green leafy vegetables in a week. <br><a href=""http://4.eat/"">4.Eat</a> any one fruit daily.<br>5.Take oxygen from nose and push it out from mouth. <br>This theory is discovered by us after a deep study in which we consider coronavirus not as a virus but as a new subject in which we started from zero.<br>May be you think that this &quot; five circle theory &quot; is not new but this is also true that when vaccine and medicine are not a part of human then also human life survive ,during the study of coronavirus Ayurveda data was so much helpful for us and this theory challenge all the humans which tell that we follow this &quot;five circle theory &quot;  but still we are having covid-19. And we appeal to you that if you and your team will discuss on this topic so it will be more helpful for all human life , each and every human have certain life and all the humans are made of elements like calcium, magnesium, iron etc .  But this also true which we cannot deny that science and many theory increased the LER ,The nature  provides us all these things but we forget that , even we forget that only because of plants we human survive , we all get food from plants , in this earth no one is having capability too produce food for human.<br>The &quot;Five circle theory &quot; is a result of very deep thinking, deep study , collection  of too much confidential sources and explored many hidden truths and also not to tell but sacrifice our family valuable time."

1681,"Shot by a man known to Police, who HAD been searched and was also handcuffed with his hands behind his back. Does this make any sense? How is it even possible? It isn&#39;t, the suspect obviously had help, and seeing as the only people in the custody suite were police then it must have been police that helped him. Which does make sense and is far more likely than the nonsense coming out through official channels. The witness/es must have already indicated that the suspect shot himself otherwise how has that story materalised? Hopefully it&#39;s not just an assumpton by the police who persumably were the first ones on the scene. I can&#39;t wait to see how Police are going to wiggle out of this one. My bet is the suspect doesn&#39;t survive long enough to stand trial in front of a full jury. The murder looks like a manchurian candidate (the patsy) gangland style execution to me. Police are the biggest gang on the streets. Why was Sgnt Ratana retiring at 54? Why did Ratana think the &#39;safest&#39; thing he could do in his last 3 or 4 months of service was to work inside, as indicated by a friend? Had he been threatened outside?

It happened about a month ago and all that&#39;s happened since is a suspected supplier of the weapon has been arrested. Could this be because Police already knew who supplied it? Maybe under cover police actually bought it."

Communities and lives would change. Gov&#39;t, Central Bank and big Companies Economics means poverty needs to exist for money to have value and inflation to stay low, a group has to remain in poverty and still breed for this to happen. As black people remains in poverty, police have the responsibility of enforcing these poor pressure cooker areas, and the American system means there is money in arrests, fines and putting people in prison. Yes, many bad apples get in these jobs, and go over the top and feel the pressure to hit the statistics. So my point is, police violence on black people only happens because economics dictates it, and there is other ways communities to come together to change it. Support black businesses is the only way."

What happened to the days I could enter a venue and pay with cash and get on with my life like a free person? What if I don&#39;t own a smartphone? I do not consent to being tracked by anyone for any reason. That&#39;s just my personal boundary.
1760,Hundreds of people at my work and most of us aren‚Äôt allowed phones  in work
1761,"The question has to be asked: WHY, has the Government used the acronym NHS on this?  This has absolutely NOTHING to do with the NHS!  In fact, this track and trace thing is run by SERCO, a PRIVATE company, who knows NOTHING about health at all."
1762,Nope.
1763,Check out Vernon Coleman on brandnewtube to hear what Emma Barnett reveals about BBC policy and &quot;anti vaxxers.&quot;  BAN THE BBC!!!!
1764,Oh nooo.
1765,This is so ridiculous

1767,Look at the poor economy I took a wise decision on investing in forex/binary options trading and guess what???!I made huge profits using his signals @Dennis__forex09 on instagram help me ü§ó

1769,"All thanks to Dr godfather for helping me to  bring back my husband, I was heartbroken when my husband told me is over between us for three years, one day I was on the internet when I say a testimony about a great spell caster called Dr godfather, how he help a woman to bring back her husband who was divorce  for  5years, so I also contacted Dr godfather he told me all I need to do and I did as I was told, he also told me within 3days my boyfriend will be back, I was so surprise to see my lover begging me that he is so sorry, I&#39;m so happy my boyfriend is back to me, if you are in need of any kind of spell casting you can also contact him today on his email drgodfatherspellcaster1 @<a href=""http://gmail.com/"">gmail.com</a> or WhatsApp him +2347062606817."
1770,"I was infected with Herpes virus, and we started taking medication for us to live healthy. There was a day I went online and searched for a cure for our virus, I saw many comments and many post until I saw a testimony about Dr Osaka and how he helped so many people get cure to their virus on the site. I contacted him and told him how i and my wife got our Herpes virus, he told me what we will have to do, which we did.After he finished, he told me that we will take his medication for a week which we also did so and 2 weeks ago we went for test and surprisingly i and my wife are now HIV negative. I am so happy that I got my wife infected and I also made him negative. All thanks goes to God for bringing Dr Osaka my way and at this point if there&#39;s anybody who is infected and you think there&#39;s no way of making yourself negative again I must tell you, that&#39;s a lie because Dr Osaka will make you negative again. contact (drosakaherb@gmail) or contact His  Whatsapp +2348136574975 there for you Thanks to Dr Osaka<br><br>He can also cure<br><br>Herpes virus<br><br>Gonorrhea<br><br>Low sperm count<br><br>Skip disease<br><br>HIV / AIDS<br><br>Arthritis<br><br>HERPES 1/2<br><br>CANCER<br><br>ALS (Lou Gehrig&#39;s disease)<br><br>Hepatitis B<br><br>chronic pancreatic<br><br>emphysema"
1771,All this crap just because some dude in China eat bat.. Yeah right... Pull the other one.
1772,What we actually need here is a five million jobs plan with future planning set in place in review of that plan. What creates jobs in a economy?
1773,He wants to be the next PM. Not on my vote. He is one from the scam team
1774,"Foolishness, you destroyed the economy because you were afraid of covid-19"
1775,"They are going to destroy the country, not to improve! Who are they and who&#39;s behind that?!"
1776,This is there plan to control us like sheep
1777,"His jobs safe though isn&#39;t it. Fuck these lot now, I do not comply at all with your draconian takeover"
1778,this is ridiculous... people that have health problems can not live like this.... the government should be protecting them not sending out to die either by the disease or by becoming homeless!
1779,EXACTLY why EVERYONE needs to start online biz like YESTERDAY!! üòç<br>I been working from home for 12 years never depending on jobs or government for assistance.üëä‚úÖüëä<br>ask me how (find me on facebook)
1780,Hope he loses his
1781,"This plandemic is just the latest manifestation of the archonic agenda. If you would like an in depth understanding of what really is our situation here, what is behind it and what we can do to regain our sovereignty, would highly recommend this book (it&#39;s free) - <a href=""https://www.abigailsinsights.com/the-holographic-matrix-3/"">https://www.abigailsinsights.com/the-holographic-matrix-3/</a>"
1782,Here&#39;s an idea lets destroy even more business and jobs with brexit...<br>You middle class voted for decades of neoliberal lead piss on the poor policy and that is the shit that brexit grew on.<br>SUCK<br>IT<br>UP
1783,And many of those losing their jobs WERE the holier than thou that poured scorn on the unemployed...THEY deserve all the shit they get.<br>Now you know what you voted for. neoliberal piss on the poor policy for decades.<br>And a benefits system which amounts to a form of psychological abuse. Suck it up.<br>Stop subsidising the richies business and lets have that real competitive capitalism you right wingdings so obviously love FOR REAL.
1784,Jesus Christ this is going nuclear
1785,This country going to die soon
1786,"Come on Brexit, UK to leave EU so I can finally taste those chlorinated chickens. Mmmm."
1787,"Because of bias reporting by the bbc,i"
1788,"When you send a boy to do a mans work then don‚Äôt be surprised if it all goes wrong. When your Chief  Negotiator has never done a Trade Deal in his life outside a Car Showroom, why do you expect a good return ?"
1789,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doAfQ4ocoyc&amp;feature=share"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doAfQ4ocoyc&amp;feature=share</a>"
1790,Because the UK has no BALLS! That&#39;s why. and we voted to leave not a deal.
1791,Scum bbc
1792,It‚Äôs hard because left wing scum refuse to acknowledge the ref result
1793,"Because the EU still want to control our fishing grounds, have the UK under their laws and tell wether we can support our industries or not. In fact they still want to rule us. So WTO No Deals"
1794,BBC AND ALL WHO WORK FOR IT ARE SCUM.
1795,Can anybody tell me what better deal?
1796,internet historian
1797,"As usual, the BBC only majors  on a one-sided bias position. <br>With no deal, the UK will have to start paying tariffs exporting to the EU. What the BBC conveniently forgets to say, is that the EU exports far more to the UK;  touch√©, Britain will just mirror the EU&#39;s tariffs placed upon our goods. <br>The EU wants unfettered access to the UK, and the UK wants to reciprocate this. <br>Where is Britain going wrong."
1798,"I feel feed-up with the system.  Want a no deal, I feel :(."
1799,"the puppet of cummings. pssst boris, i have a new slogan for you"

1802,Because the EU wants to make the UK a vassal state rather than let it return to independent status.
1803,Brexit was a fraud scheme.
1804,"Haha england said Okey i will stay in the EU like 60 years i will take profit of that, and of course i will have pounds not euros, so i can have profit on that too, and i will so my brexit and pay nothing. And EU IS DOING NOTHING!!!"
1805,"The EU are demonstrating exactly why we&#39;re leaving, acting like a vindictive, preaching bully and getting involved in British politics with its underhand attempt to unite the island of Ireland.<br>Tell big brother where to go, they don&#39;t govern us and don&#39;t believe the BBC, you know whose side they will take in their propoganda campaign."
1806,. <br>It seems that the Omnicron-virus is the best immune-booster people can get. I hope the Omnicron-virus ends the CoV-crisis.
1807,"There is much information available online about the epidemics of 1957 and 1968; I remember both.  No media hysteria, muzzle wearing, distancing , TV brainwashing, or creative statistics.  Wake up!  Reclaim your freedom.  Live again!"
1808,Done with the BBC. Don‚Äôt care if they try and claw things back and act like they have an ounce journalistic integrity. <br>üëã
1809,"Whitty and valance should both be sacked , bloody stupid in not knowing what was coming again!!!!"
1810,Vallance and Whitty have became the most hated men in the UK
1811,"Fire them all, clearly they are acting against people‚Äôs interests. So much of this scam has been exposed. Belinda and Mel Gates‚Äôs agenda for depopulation is a fraud and driven by enormous amounts of money dished out to governments and companies to sell their people. How much more sinister can this plandemic get?!"
1812,"Yes, Herd Immunity?   A stampede of cows is seen running towards a cliff where they will  ultimately die.  Of the thousands of cows, one of the cows looks at another cow that&#39;s also on the run and asks, &quot;Hey buddy, why are you running?&quot; And that&#39;s when the other cow answers, &quot;I don&#39;t know.  I&#39;m running because that other cow is running&quot;.  WTF?  People please.....wake up!"
1813,Boris wanted this too. So dont forget to loop him in.
1814,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqIYDTIdg2o"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqIYDTIdg2o</a>"
1815,Whitty and Valance are vaccine salesmen! The fear narrative is still being pushed despite the death to cases ratio at an all time low. We only have cases because the PCR test is so wildly inaccurate! Unbelievably 90+ tests are false positives!
1816,Eugenics!
1817,"these 2 are corrupt liars, has the BBC reported on how Vallance has ¬£600,000 worth of shares in GSK, the company contracted to produce the covid vaccine? they are both along with hancock deliberately trying to spread fear to the British people with totally bogus stats."
1818,"Total rubbish the virus was let in on propose so they could get as many off us infected so the goverment scientist&#39;s could get antibodies and a vaccine and to hell with the most vunerable in nursing homes, hospital&#39;s and others etc.The goverment and chief medical advisors etc should be all sacked and accountable for there lack of response to this crises as they are all a disgrace as round two of the thinning out begins......"
1819,"&quot;Take Down the BBC&quot; - <a href=""https://youtu.be/t708LwKPTcs"">https://youtu.be/t708LwKPTcs</a>"
1820,"All the government advisors have obvious conflicts of interest in being beholden to big pharma and Gates,  but none so obviously as Vallance."
1821,"Great strategy Boris, make everyone destitute so they cannot afford to go to the Trafalgar Square protest. Destroy the lives of as many as you can so even less can afford to protest.  BBC news at 17.00 and no coverage yet masses of coverage for the destruction of statues and black lives matter protests. BBC even covered a small number of anti lockdown protests in USA and Europe, but none of the protests going on around this country and now the third one in Trafalgar Square. According to the government this Covid scam is the worst crisis to have hit the planet! You would think they would be unbiased and cover all the issues connected with the biggest tragedy the world has ever faced! With a quarter of the UK citizens now on lock down Valence and Whitty standing to make money out of their undeclared connections with the Pharmaceutical Industry one has to ask, are we all living a nightmare and will finally wake up? You could not make up all the corruption and idiotic behaviour within UK government. At least the Evening Standard have loaded a you tube video about the protest today in Trafalgar Square!  Thank you Evening Standard and Russia Today for your excellent coverage! No wonder people are cancelling their BBC licence!"

1862,They are hungry in search of food which is very scarce due to overfishing by giant size travellers.whales are intelligent like humans and they never like to suicide without strong reason.
1863,Omg These poor animals.
1864,Maybe somebody should design equipment to specifically help beached animals?  There is no profit in doing so however so I have no idea why somebody would do it unless they really want to save the animals.  Maybe some rich guy who was saved by a whale when he was small would come along and fund such a project.

1913,"Looking at some of the comments here... Yeah, no wonder there are 200,000 deaths. More than half a year into the pandemic and so many people seem to still have no basic understanding of Covid. Covid isn&#39;t just &#39;flu&#39; or &#39;flu-like&#39;. Covid affects your immune system and thus affects your body&#39;s ability to deal with a number of other diseases/pre-existing conditions that you&#39;re then susceptible too. Hence if someone has Covid, and dies from pneumonia, or died from an existing condition that was, prior to Covid, manageable, then YES, those ARE Covid deaths. Because without the Covid factor, we are saying they could&#39;ve had a much higher chance of survival. If someone who has Covid got hit by a car, then NO, those aren&#39;t covid deaths and aren&#39;t recorded as such. Your country isn&#39;t the only country doing it in this manner - almost every other country is doing it the same way. And still, America, 200,000 deaths. We have 27 deaths where I&#39;m from and that&#39;s 27 too many - shouldn&#39;t have happened. But I guess for some people in the US, 90ish% of survival, 200,000 deaths, that&#39;s not too bad at all, this whole thing is a scam~ ...Idiocy is the more horrifying factor here."
