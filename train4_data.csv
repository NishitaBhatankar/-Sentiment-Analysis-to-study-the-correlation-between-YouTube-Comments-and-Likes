68,Hi
69,This chanal is helpful for us
70,Stay away this country is just a big industrial park.
71,wow very  beautiful 😍
72,where are the list of the best places in belgium
73,"The sign-attribution of Belgium is Celtic; from Gauls.  I didn&#39;t really understand that; have been startled by a feeling of clarity, with certain photos, from Belgium!  The clarity is natural, as our patriarchal attribution is also best Celtic- especially Scottish.  That is the sign of this entire continent, including Canada.  We can be Germanic, or Irish, easily- the subtle differences make Scottish Celtic our best, or surest.  A problem is, there exists no such sign, or attribution called by the name American; the name U.S.A. doesn&#39;t reflect one any whit more... they are names of an Asynchronization.  Due to certain Sublime World developments and changes, they are correctly now assayed as of Forbidden; names to use.  Best is to use Nova Scotia, or Alba Nuadh for this land, including Canada, which should perhaps be called Upper Nova Scotia.  This is profoundly more wise.  The sacrifice of an official change, I&#39;m sure there would be a great blessing, pursuant!  This, along with forsaking Frisian, or English language, is the best portent or indication that I know of; deanglicising.  There no longer exists a Frisian or English such attribution.  Monarchism should best have cessated completely by around 1800 A.D..  It was very unwise to try and continue with it, even in a very diluted format.  Aquarius wouldn&#39;t let any such in.  Generally, birth as Belgique, U.K., Irish, German, Swedish were a little more fortunate than birth in this mixed up land- but a fly in the ointment, a valiant eschewal of anything Monarchism was indicated.  The French were not too violent, in their valiance for this; no American Revolution was justified at all, however.  Obtaining possession of a land through violence, combination and bloodshed is a most forbidden means, especially if the purveyors of it don&#39;t really have much worthiness.  They bore a curse of Odiousness, those; couldn&#39;t have success in European society; not anyplace, really..."
74,"One thing I like about Belgium, is their chocolate. I buy them at my trader joes store here in California. Best chocolate I&#39;ve ever had, and it&#39;s cheap as hell, too."
75,Great video
76,"I live in belgium and I would add an important point : Keep in mind that each city has a french name and a dutch name, and they can be very different, so you could have severe trouble to know where you are if nobody tells you this fact. Also the trainstations use the name depending of their region, so everything will be in french in wallonia, but once the train will reach a dutch city the name will be in dutch so you could believe you aren&#39;t at the good place and stay in the train, you won&#39;t be noticed when you cross the regions and if you don&#39;t be carefull you could believe you are in a different country in 10 minutes, that&#39;s totaly normal in Belgium. Be careful because most tourist I meet are lost or struggle to find some places. Also most people doesn&#39;t speak both languages, so I suggest to use english if you can. I would also add that the country is very windy, and the wind comes from the north, so when it&#39;s 20°C outside it&#39;s like 15°C. Only 2 or 3 month at summer are sunny and tolerable, the rest of the yeat it&#39;s rainy and cold. You could also struggle to find a public bathroom, according to the law each city must have toilet, but they are often very well hidden, broken, or dirty, so go to the toilet at the trainstations or in a shop/coffee. The Ardenens are nice but be carefull with bikes, because it&#39;s never flat, if you are bad a sport it won&#39;t be cool for you. The bus are often kind of random when you leave a big city, the could be very late, I personnaly don&#39;t trust them as a citizen when I have a meeting. The trains are often late and you can easily miss your correspondence, they are also overcrowed, especially during friday and sunday. Overcrowed means it&#39;s impossible to sit. You can also visit Walibi Belgium if you like RollerCoasters, or Pairi Daiza if you like animals, it&#39;s a super nice theme park, but it&#39;s only good during summer, I suggest to visit the caves when it&#39;s cold outside, it&#39;s less overcrowded and the temperature is always the same underground."

244,love this video! one thing that I learned and wanted to share with you is to look for a duffle bag that best fits your luggage and has all the wonderful features a bag can have especially in plane travel use. I&#39;m using Nomad Lane&#39;s Bento Bag and it&#39;s a good choice.

265,Wow i never thought new mexico have all these amazing places is like arizona everyone thinks is only desert
266,Except they&#39;re all closed due to covid. New Mexico is scared of it&#39;s own shadow.
267,Hopefully I can visit this state and other states one day. I’ve been living in New York my whole life and I’m a little fed up living in this overpopulated and messed up state. I love New York and always will but I just wanna move on to somewhere else.
268,Been wanting to go to NM when i met the man who took my heart away but we didnt work out. Still wishing to get there though to see the nature’s gift through my naked eyes.

296,"You Texans better beware, there&#39;s a lot of those nutty Californians running from their state and heading to yours and they will ruin your state just as they did in California. California today is a socialist shithole haven for radical anti-American ideals. Maybe the big earthquake will fix that problem. Its disgusting what California&#39;s leadership did to that state."

319,"Enjoyed 3 Highland Games in Dunoon. Loved watching the pipers come through town after the games. Got lit and drove my friends motorcycle down Argyll Street in a kilt and I was dressed as a true Scotsman. Used to love to eat at the Coylet Inn on Loch Eck. Would hike up the hill behind where I was staying, house on Midge Lane, and walk to it then take a cab back. The chef Maggie was incredible. Venison with mushrooms in a red wine gravy and the best Gateaus I&#39;ve ever eaten. I&#39;m glad it was rebuilt after the fire. Such a beautiful place. Going for a drive and taking the ferry to Bute was always fun. Really enjoyed driving down the road with pheasants sitting on the fences looking at the weird Americans. Strolling down Sauchiehall in Glasgow when it was safe. I&#39;ve heard it&#39;s a bit rough now and the &quot;Glasgow smile&quot; is making a comeback."
320,"I want to go to Fort William (good base to see Glencoe, Eilean Donan and Isle of Skye)"

329,"Number 7 St Andrews made me laugh out loud.  &quot;....most well known for the 3rd oldest university...&quot;  That&#39;s hilarious.  Nope...St Andrews is most famous (and ONLY famous....to one heck of a lot of people) for St Andrews golf course....the birthplace of golf, and the undisputed mecca of golf for every player of the game.  Thousands of tourists go to Scotland every year just to play that course....and then leave.  Sorry, but any mention of St Andrews has to lead with that fact.  Still, nice vid though."
330,"Thank you so much for filming such a beautiful video. I studied in Scotland, now living in California, and have so much love to that land. So many beautiful memories. The most beautiful winter I had in my life was in Scotland. I hope I’ll visit it again sometime in the future."

338,"Please explain how the south coast dates back 185 million years. What evidence do you have? There is a mountain of evidence  ( archealogical, scientific, Grand Canyon et al ) that the earth as we  know it is circa 6000 years old. Buy a King James Bible and study the historic timelines before you peddle rediculous figures in time.<br>Apart from that, the video is good."

369,"Just a suggestion.. Don&#39;t waste time going to Cordoba... It&#39;s just an old rotten city.... Nothing to do or see, and far away from every tourist attraction.<br>Also don&#39;t go to Ibera park in any season other than winter, it gets extremely hot (can get above 40 Celsius!) and there&#39;s not a single tree for shadow. Even in winter it can get really hot often!"
370,"Beautiful landscapes, but Poor, insecure, corrupt country."
371,"Great video but as an Argentinian I must tell  you missed wonderful places such as Salinas Grandes , Quebrada de Humauca , valle de la Luna,  Tafi del Valle , among others placed in the North of the country . <br>Thanks for showing the beauty of my country! ❤️"
372,"Espectacularmente impresionante, claro que faltaron muchísimas más bellezas de Argentina que no se pudieron mostrar. Besos Abrazos Bendiciones desde Lincoln Argentina"

375,"In another video you say that &quot;Garganta del Diablo&quot; fall in Iguazu is better appreciatted from de Brazilian side, but this is untruth, and 80% of the falls belongs to Argentina and you can watch directly from Argentinean side. Also the church catedral who appears in minute <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmNNS-EsgT0&amp;t=13m02s"">13:02</a> is located in the city of Lujan and not in Buenos Aires city.

387,"How sad that you didn&#39;t even mention the Colorado national monument. It was one of the coolest nateral washes I have ever seen. It made me truly wonder what the earth looked like a few hundred thousand years ago. Thats ok though really I guess, the less people tramping through there the better. I heard from a local that Vail is a nightmare unless you are a loaded paying customer. Thats where all the entitled people of the world keep their sandbox. Don&#39;t expect to be treated decent if you are an average human being."
388,"A few of those make my top ten, but several of mine are missing, such as Mt. Princeton Hot Springs and the many old mining trail passes (Imogene, Tin Cup, Hancock, Engineer, etc.)."

I still need to show all the tropical potential that Peru has with its Amazonian territory, which represents 70% of the total of the Country! In Peru the Amazon is born, in fact it is the 4th country with the most tropical forests in the world and by territorial extension it has more jungle territory than Brazil itself, which only covers 59% of its territory.

494,"I have been there 20 years ago. Visited and &quot;lived&quot; the top 7 places in the list and I could not agree more with the beauty of those places. However, there are a couple of places missing, certainly top 3 in the list. The &quot;Cordillera Blanca&quot;, an amazing place that include the biggest mountains in the country, and magical sites like the Llanganuco Lakes and the Lake Paron. The &quot;Inca Trail&quot; a 4-5 day walking journey crossing the most spectacular natural landscapes and inca ruins."

611,"I have learned for 10 years that nature in Indonesia often rages when it wakes up from its sleep, and even gets the title as the number 1 natural disaster that occurs the most in the world. Queen Mother Earth in Indonesia is very different from other countries, looks very beautiful but also very deadly.<br><br>List of total natural disasters in Indonesia from 2015 - 2021:<br><br>In 2015 there were 1.694 natural disasters.<br>In 2016 there were 2.342 natural disasters.<br>In 2017 there were 2.175 natural disasters.<br>In 2018 there were 1.999 natural disasters.<br>In 2019 there were 9.375 natural disasters.<br>In 2020 there were 2.925 natural disasters.<br>In 2021 there were 2.796 natural disasters.<br><br>That is why tourism in Indonesia is only ranked 30th in the world, even though it has a very unique nature. Because many foreign tourists prefer to stay away from Indonesia and go to other countries, not because they don&#39;t want to go but for their own safety. However, Indonesia is special, because it has the Queen Mother Earth on a much different level (there are so many natural attractions that don&#39;t make sense). As far as I know, Indonesia is a place for exploration and adventure, not for honeymoon or relaxing."

615,Truly a beautiful nation. Lots to offer for tourists and especially for Filipinos. Thank God for the nature.
616,....Maganda..... Trully beautiful place and people.I am married to a Pinay and been to some places mentioned on here still plenty to visit.Greetings from New Zealand and Czech Republic....
617,What I like about our country the most aside from its unique and beautiful islands is the tropical climate.
618,"Visit also up nortth, particular Pagudpod!"
619,"I&#39;m an expat in the Philippines, and I still have not visited many of the locations shown! But when the pandemic ends..."
620,batanes and mountain province should be on that list
621,As a Filipino 🇵🇭 I have NOT visited these places.
622,You haven’t included Baguio city from your list of tourist destinations!
623,"We have also  100 islands, Bolinao,Baguo   and from the southern part of the Philippines..."
624,And also hold the record of the largest crocodile 🐊 and biggest caldera in the world 🌎 ph so amazing
625,This is for sure based on her actual experience but I can&#39;t agree enough with Bohol at number 9 because you have there the Panglao Island with the International airport once you landed there you already surrounded with white sand beaches which is not in Boracay or any top island in the Phils I&#39;m sure Boracay has no international airport just within the island.

635,"Literally just got back from Iceland today and it was utterly breathtaking. Me and my girlfriend have seen it in full ice mode so think next we go in the summer. It’s definitely not cheap so save plenty of money and alcohol/food when you are there is very expensive and not as openly available as in other places so if you enjoy a drink I recommend buying at duty free to save some cash later! The nature side was incredible, golden circle tour and blue lagoon were easily my top picks but definitely check out the cathedral in Reykjavik as the views are stunning and it’s about £7 each to go up so not all that bad"

706,"L&#39;ambassade du Maroc en Suisse doit être contrôlée pour voir la qualité de ses services et de ceux qu&#39;elle ne rendent pas aux marocains résidents en Suisse qui ferment les yeux et ont intérêt à  obtenir leur passeports et cartes d&#39;identité sans problèmes. <br><br>L&#39;ambassade Suisse sert les intérêts de ses citoyens e Suisse, investit beaucoup d&#39;énergie et de savoir faire pour faciliter les démarches et pour les Suisses et pour les investisseurs marocains qui désirent investir en Suisse. <br><br>Mais L&#39;ambassade Marocaine ne fait pas pareil pour les investisseurs Suisses, leur complique les démarches, j&#39;étais surprise d&#39;écouter un investisseur Suisse de Genève me raconter son mécontentement vis à  vis de cette ambassade. <br><br>Mais les Suisse investisseurs au Maroc se plaignent des démarches de ces fonctionnaires marocains sur le sol Suisse  qui ne font rien pour les  faciliter. Le Suisse n&#39; a pas l&#39;habitude de donner du bakchich à  son administration parfaite d&#39;ailleurs et qui lui envoie ses papiers jusqu&#39;à chez lui! <br><br>L&#39;ambassade quand il contraire le Suisse et lui parle de règles et lois, ses fonctionnaires s&#39;attendent à  ce que le Demandeur Suisse ou marocains lui donne un gros bakchic sinon ils n&#39;auront pas leur papiers d&#39;investissement comme ils le veulent... <br><br>Étant d&#39;origine Marocaines, une fois j&#39; avais fait les démarches pour mon passeport marocain,  quand j&#39;ai payé, le fonctionnaire m&#39;a dit qu&#39;il n&#39;a pas la monnaie pour que je lui laisse le reste. Comme au Maroc, c&#39;est une astuce car il a la monnaie. <br><br>En plus il faut aller  chercher le passeport une fois prêt, il n&#39;a y a que les marocains qui corrompent L&#39;ambassade qui reçoivent leur passeports chez eux et c&#39;est un fonctionnaire qui les leur amène chez eux. <br><br>Depuis je n&#39;ai plus renouvelé mon passeport marocain. Étant naturalisée je voyage avec mon passeport Suisse que je reçois chez moi comme tous les Suisses.  Et pour une autre raison c&#39;est que L&#39;ambassade du Maroc se trouve à Berne en Suisse côté alémanique, très  loin de Lausanne où j&#39;habites, L&#39;ambassade ne répond pas souvent et vous avez le risque d&#39;aller sans téléphoner pour la trouver fermée, fête nationale ou autres... <br><br>Pour ce qui est du consulat marocain à  Genève qui est pas loin comme L&#39;ambassade. Je ne sais pas à  quoi sert ce consulat qui ne livre ni passeports ni carte d&#39;identitée... <br><br>J&#39;ai eu le malheur de faire appel à leurs service, une incompétence et malhonnêteté incomparables ! J&#39;étais prise en otage par un hôtel 5* à Marrakech au Maroc, le Kenzi Rose Garden ancien Kenzi Farah. <br><br>- veuillez lire les délais dessous- Et j&#39;ai contaté  L&#39;ambassade et le consulat pour qu&#39;ils transmettent mon dossier aux autorités Marocaines vu que le ministère du tourisme ne répondait pas ni aucun ministère personne au Maroc ne m&#39;a répondu. <br><br>L&#39;ambassade n&#39;a rien fait, j&#39;ai attendu une année avant de la relancer j&#39;étais en colère, au lieu de répondre par e-mail, pour ne pas laisser de traces, un fonctionnaire m&#39; a téléphoné pour me dire non, alors je lui ai envoyé un email et à  plusieurs administrations en laissant les adresses emails visibles ...C&#39;était gênant j&#39;ai écris que L&#39;ambassade m&#39;a téléphoné et a refusé de transmettre mon dossier par téléphone. <br><br>Suite à cet envoi d&#39;email, j&#39;ai reçu un appel de L&#39;ambassade, mais je n&#39;ai pas répondu. Je n&#39;avais plus confiance. <br><br>Et j&#39;ai publié  partout que L&#39;ambassade a refusé de transmettre mon dossier au Maroc, et que j&#39;ai encore recu un deuxième appel, qui sert à  rien! <br><br>L&#39;ambassade avait le dossier de  l&#39;incident complet et que ma vie ainsi que la vie de m&#39;a famille est en danger, car le gérant des hôtels kenzi a menacé ma famille  au Maroc en envoyant deux personnes à  leur domicile, j&#39;ai l&#39;email que j&#39;ai envoyé à  ce gérant, ses hommes ont été vu par des témoins et la résidence de ma famille est équipée de caméras. <br><br>Ce gérant n&#39;est autre que Monsieur Abdellatif Khabbaj, ancien conseiller de Sa Majesté le Roi du Maroc, président de la confédération nationale du tourismse jusqu&#39;à cet été.

772,"😎😎 No wonder why Thailand has been selected as one of the most visited countries in the world for 5 consecutive years. Because the Cost of living is cheap, Complete facilities, Good public utilities, Good transportation, can travel easily and cheaply. The food is delicious and very clean even street food Inexpensive and modern rooms are very luxurious. Thai people are very hospitable and friendly when seeing foreigners.  I hope to go back to Thailand one more time.  😍😍"
773,"it s not located in the Balkans, Balkan is a mountain in Bulgaria, we are far from Bulgaria. There is no Balkan peninsula either. The term is a political term, and so Croatia does not consider itself part of that group. It is a term British coined.

Allah sent  the Prophet Muhammad to guide the whole world to worship Allah alone, If they become Muslims and follow The Qur&#39;an and the teachings of the Prophet Muhammad, they will enter heaven, and who did not become Muslim and remained on Judaism or Christianity or Atheism or Agnosticism or Buddhism or Satanism or Hinduism or Paganism or any religion other than Islam will enter hell.</b><br><br><b>I would like to introduce the greatest book that exists in the world to you, which is the Qur’an, it is the book of the Lord, Once you read the Qur’an you will feel that it is a special book, if someone asks me what is the evidence that the Qur&#39;an is the book of the Lord, I will say that there is a lot of evidence that the Qur&#39;an is the book of the Lord, such as that the Lord challenged mankind to produce just one chapter like the Qur&#39;an chapters but mankind were unable to , and such as the absence of errors in the Qur&#39;an, and such as Reports of matters of the unseen,  both past and future, There is no doubt that any intelligent person will know that this book is divine.</b><br><br><b>Reading The Qur&#39;an will certainly convert you to Islam unless you are against The Truth, Therefore, I ask you to read the Qur’an with reflect and concentration and to do what is mentioned in it in order to enter a new world after death and to live the eternal life you wish for, and to have all the pleasures you want without getting a job.</b><br><br><b>If you have any questions, find the answers in the right sources and stay away from false sources.</b><br><br><b>I wish you guidance and happiness.</b><br><br><i>__________________________________________________________________</i>"

803,"&lt;3 Our world is so wonderful. Ask yourself :  are Your Forefathers who had built all up for you proud of you  today?  What do you do now, in your life to keep and guard it in the same condition ? What do you remark and observe around you what you want your children or grandchildren to see and watch or use....Ask yourself. These questions  I started being interested while I was watching this video. Lighthouses are so unique bulidings they could deserve all to give them the world heritage board in the front of them. &lt;3 Thank you for this beautiful video."

824,"At the expense of sounding ignorant. In my opinion most of these famous paintings are not good pieces of art work at all (some are) I think they are famous for various other reasons and influencers. However, i can appreciate their timeless beauty and value. Everyone has a different opinion or perception of art and i tend to be slightly against the mainstream. It would be interesting to see someone comment on this. And i respect people who appreciate this kind of art. I am more into realism style, and art that emanate highly evolved creative abilities."

830,"I have been fortunate to have seen all of these, all in their home museums, and most multiple times on exhibition tours. Art is so much fun and these are certainly some of the most iconic works in history. Nicely voiced over too. Well done."
831,"Three of these are Dutch. Also recognized around the world are Escher, Mondrian and Hieronymus Bosch.<br>Might it be, because the Dutch love big windows and are thus clearly visually orientated?<br>Because I bet you can&#39;t name a world famous Dutch musician other than DJ&#39;s.  ;) <br>And the Irish with their dark little houses with little windows? We all know some of their writers and singers.<br>So context creates culture, culture creates art."
832,"Love art ,I took 2years commercial art, and 1year of art in college. I am a spectator for art, painting and <br>Medium of artist."

862,"None of the palaces in the list are more beautiful than Mysore Palace and Umaid Bhawan Palace in India. And Peterof Palace is more beautiful than Winter Palace in reality. Agree that Forbiden palace is the largest palace complex in the world but I doubt is the most beautiful. I dont mind to give top position to Palace of Varsales or even Patiola palce though. By the way, Hava Mahal is not even a seperate palace but is just a part of Jaipur city palace complex."
863,England had such economic might for centuries and built some of the most boring palaces and landscapes. If you&#39;re going to colonize the world at least build something impressive and imaginative with that stolen wealth!

885,Geez. Almost all of the Segovia aqueduct is made of stone and doesn&#39;t feature &quot;brickwork&quot;.
886,Its so sad so many of these buildings have been destroyed and ransaked over the centuries.
887,"Terrific. Great video, and thanks. These structures have withstood centuries of weather, pilfering for building materials, and the ravages of wars.<br>Now.... how do you think these huge structures were built?<br>Wait for it...<br>Slave labor. <br>That’s right. By slaves. The Romans regularly used males captured in war or simply taken from regions not part of the Empire, shipped them around the Empire, and used them to build the amazing structures that we marvel at today. Oh sure, there were building contractors, just as there are today, but the labor force? Slaves.<br>Don’t get this confused with structures built by the Army like Hadrian’s Wall in Britain, and the outlying nodes of their incredible road networks. Those projects were assigned to the Legions. But the majority of the enormous temples, aqueducts, arenas, and other structures? By slaves.<br>So hey, “Progressives”, get busy tearing down everything Roman you can get your hands on, and cancel the entire history of Rome."

1032,"If you were given a free ticket to Paradise, would you go? Ask yourself, “Where is Paradise and what would you find there?” Beaches, palms, and surf? Mountains and snow-capped peaks? Is Paradise the unity of mankind and peace on earth?<br>Paradise is actually the place where God dwells. Most people think they will go to Paradise when they die, but let’s see if that’s true. Have you ever lied or stolen? Liars and thieves won’t be in Paradise. Have you lusted after others, or dishonored your parents? Have you cursed the God who created Paradise? If any of these are true, you’ve offended Him and broken His Law. Instead of entering Paradise, the penalty for your crimes will be eternal death in Hell. However, God offers Paradise to those who bring Him a sinless payment for their sins. Your goodness and good deeds are not that sinless payment. God will only accept the sacrifice of His sinless Son, Jesus Christ. Anyone who repents and believes in Him will be cleansed of their sins and given that free ticket to Paradise! Jesus promised the thief on the cross who trusted in Him: “…Today shalt thou be with me in paradise.” (Luke 23:43)<br>Don’t live in a “fool’s” Paradise thinking this life is all there is. God is inviting you to the “real” Paradise through faith in Jesus Christ. When you breathe your last breath and life on earth is over, will it be Paradise “lost” or Paradise “found” for you?"

1047,"<b>I swear! Before I even pass away, I will visit and explore at least 10 of these magnificent and wonderful ancient ruins.</b>"
1048,"After looking at this video and many other videos, books, and photos, one thing that strikes me is how so many disparate human civilizations have a particular building shape in common...the pyramid. I honestly wonder what draws us humans to build our religious structures or tombs or even administrative buildings (even a hotel here in the US) as pyramids. They can be sheer sided like the ones in Egypt (before people took the limestone cladding off the sides, that is), or stepped like the Mayan temples, or even a mixture like many temple complexes in Southeast Asia. It&#39;s an interesting thing to wonder about...the &quot;what makes us do this&quot; sort of question."
1049,The pyramids are not tombs. They are power stations.
1050,Absolutely wonderful. I would like to recommend a wonderful natural wonder is Son Doong Cave in Vietnam. It&#39;s the biggest cave on earth that will take you on an incredible adventure.
1051,"It is great to see these ruins in films like these, in person you cannot appreciate the details, the sizes, the expansion of the areas, I have been in several of these places butI did not have the stamina of walking and see it all, so, thank you for this beautiful traveling video."

1093,i gotta go there one day
1094,This might be the unintentionally funniest video on youtube. Absolute dogshit list. Makes me wonder if the producers have been to any of the parks at all.
1095,Wow
1096,There&#39;s a few parks that you didn&#39;t mention what state they are in.. Mesa Verde and Grand Teton for example
1097,Great smoky mountains
1098,Very Good!!!
1099,I&#39;ve been to 18 of these National Parks.  The USA is BEAUTIFUL!

1101,"We all have one thing in common, we want peace and quiet"
1102,"Ive been to Zion, Yellowstone, Grand Canyon, Mesa Verde, and the great sand dunes. By the time I&#39;m 40, I hope to explore all these national parks. One vacation a year to one of these parks. That&#39;s the plan. So I guess that means that I&#39;ll explore at least 20 of them by the time I&#39;m 40. Hopefully some day I could also go on a vacation with my future wife to other countries like Italy. Venice Italy that is. But later in life hopefully I&#39;ll be making more money to go to multiple parks a year. I&#39;m doing great with money now but not enough to save 200k for a house. Im making enough to easily save for a 20k RV though. That&#39;s the plan. With an RV it would be a lot easier to go to these parks. I&#39;m a Colorado mountain man who works at a Skii resort so yeah. First year working at a Skii resort and I love my job so much. Get paid well, get to work 50 hours a week 10 thousand feet high, season pass, and great co workers. Im thinking I want to be a snowboard instructor next year and a mountain bike instructor at steamboat springs mountain bike resort. That&#39;s the goal in life RN"

1137,"My trip while in Indonesia was very satisfying and at the same time scared me (natural disasters), I personally think Indonesia is a place of adventure and exploration. If for the sake of the honeymoon it is not suitable, then I will rate nature tourism in Indonesia 10/10. In my opinion, it is very suitable for tourists who have an adventurous spirit in the wild. This is why Indonesian tourism is still underestimated by most foreign tourists because its natural attractions are very beautiful but also deadly. <br><br>My personal opinion after visiting several countries :<br>&gt;Maldives (Very suitable as a honeymoon place, the sea is calm and beautiful).<br>&gt;Thailand (Culinary tourism because Thai food is world famous).<br>&gt;Indonesia (Nature tourism because it has a very different level, but be careful when going there because the nature is a bit unfriendly unpredictable but very satisfying and amazing).<br>&gt;Philippines (It&#39;s very easy to communicate with local people and there can also see a variety of entertainment and 7.600 islands WOW).<br>&gt;France (The country most visited by foreign tourists is number 1 in the world, because there are place names that are already known to the world, this is no joke).<br>&gt;India (My favorite place is foot massage service and the uniqueness of people in India in terms of selling or doing activities). <br><br>When I visited Indonesia, there were natural attractions that made me speechless and many natural attractions that didn&#39;t make sense. Even the place was hidden from the settlement. Nature tourism in Indonesia is like a woman who is very beautiful, unique and strange, but also very deadly because she often goes on a rampage."

1181,"Best places to visit in Europe are places that Aren&#39;t tourist traps, if you want a feel of how the people live life in any of those European countries just visit them and walk around, You will get an Experience like no other. Visit the United Kingdom and walk in the Cities that are ACTUALLY English, Don&#39;t visit London at least not the parts with all the Non-Brits, If you visit Germany Explore Munich! Its one of the Few cities in Germany that isn&#39;t Dominated by Atheist&#39;s and Immigrants so you will see Pure culture and History there, Same thing with Vienna too. Moral of the story just visit cool Historical places and you can do that anywhere in Europe you can literally walk down a Rural Roadway and find some type of damn Castle, Europe is insane."

1307,"🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 no.1 Berlin 😂😭😭😭... yes, down to the capital and get a great view of all the homeless drug addicts in the streets along with all the underground subway stations filled with more  homeless alcoholics spending their social time to avoid freezing outside. Everyone’s personality is robotised and it’s one of the most overcrowded places in Europe too. <br><br>But yes jokes aside, it’s not the worst place, it’s definitely better than Stockholm and every part of the Netherlands 🤮.. I’m a British expat residing in Munich and it is one of the best cities I’ve lived. So this video made me feel better by basically confirming that Munich is actually the best place before promoting Germany’s bureaucracy with Berlin as no.1 🤣😭💀."

1345,Avoid San Francisco is you want your car broken into. Also Oakland where a person is killed by gun violence every day and bullets fly in all directions. Oakland is one of the most dangerous city in USA where you will get robbed in daylight at anytime. California has the largest number of homelessness in USA.

1375,"People think throwing 1 plastic paper on the ground won’t harm the planet ,now imagine 1 million people think this way …."
1376,"My top 10 for any international tourist: <br><br>1) Kruger National Park. If you don&#39;t have many days, make sure to spend some time in Skukuza (Most history, restaurants as well as sleeping in a hotel in a train on the train bridge while you can watch all the animals).<br><br>2) Cape Town, Definitely visit Table Mountain, The market place plaza, Ford of Good Hope &amp; the beaches. A lot of history. To expand you can go on a boat out on Camps Bay to Seal island or from centre to Robben Island. Also options to expand to the winelands that are close by just out the city.<br><br>3) Wine Route, All between the Langeberg mountains, Swellendam, Worcester, Robertson, Montagu, Touwsrivier,  Franschoek, Stellenbosch, many many wine farms.<br><br>4) Drakensberg - Highest peak in SA, would definitely recommend either just after the rainy season is summer when it&#39;s very green, lush and BEAUTIFUL (might be hot) or in mid July when it&#39;s snowing (very beautiful).<br><br>5) Northern Kwa-Zulu Natal,  They mention the Hluhluwe game reserve (with a wrong pronunciation lol), but there&#39;s many more! Go visit St. Lucia, a beautiful town, an hour away from the Hluhluwe-Imfolozi game reserve, where you can see your big 5 animals. Also even in winter the beaches of the town are warm due to the Indian ocean. The town is also surrounded by the Isimangaliso game reserve, an estuary where the river floats into the ocean. You will truly be at peace with nature and it&#39;s much more quiet than Kruger National Park + variety. Can also extend with many game reserves even north, elephant interactions or traveling on a boat out on the river to see hippos and crocs. Don&#39;t forget Scuba-diving at the world&#39;s famous Sodwana Bay just north!<br><br>6) Johannesburg / Pretoria, Though not as WILD as many places above, the Gauteng province has all the luxury, casino&#39;s, malls, hotels and all you need. Also much history, museums and monuments. Gauteng is also very close to major destinations just outside the city (Sun City / Parys / Bela Bela / Hartbeespoort).<br><br>7) Durban, Centre Kwa-Zulu Natal, Durban is the city that never sleeps. Always sunny, beautiful beaches and don&#39;t let me start on water parks or aquariums. Tons to due in the city and if you ever want a bit of peace and quiet extend to northern KZN.<br><br>8) South Coast (Hermanus, Mossel Bay, George, Kysna, Plettenberg Bay) All dream peaceful locations with beautiful green scenery, forests, mountains and beaches. Whale watching? Hermanus. Best Beaches, Mossel Bay area. Biggest &quot;city&quot; &amp; shops, George. Most forests / hiking / camping all from Knysna to Plett.<br><br>9) Northern Cape - Not so popular with first time visitors as you&#39;re heading into the dessert of SA, but there are some beautiful scenery just need to travel quite a distance. Sutherland, Massive telescopes where you can watch the stars and planets at night. Kimberley, Kimberley&#39;s hole, mine &amp; museum. Namaqualand. beautiful beautiful flowers in the desert once a year. <br><br>10) Lowveld (Blyde River Canyon, Mac Mac Falls, God&#39;s Window, Pinacle Rock &amp; so so much more beautiful scenery). Forests, green, nice hiking, close to Kruger National Park. <br><br>11) <b>Special shout out</b> Sun City (Holiday Resort, Golf Estate, Lodges, Pilanesberg national park) View nature in a hot air balloon &amp; sky diving (2 hours away from Gauteng). &amp; Port Elizabeth (Not as popular as the Western Cape &amp; quite isolated), PE has beautiful beaches for a peaceful holiday away from all the buzz of people rushing to the beach. <b>It can get very windy in the Eastern Cape</b>"
1377,Ya
1378,Adding the beauty of the Northern Cape during Namaqualand&#39;s flowering time and the Kgalagadi would have been another plus.

Ярко окрашенные здания столицы Кубы могли бы все облизывать краской, но это, вероятно, только умалило бы атмосферу, которую Гавана имеет в ведрах.<br>Посетители смогут насладиться богатством выставленных исторических зданий. Его живописные площади - восхитительное место, чтобы скоротать день, наблюдая за проходом Кадиллака и слушая сальсу, которая гипнотически играет над эфирными волнами.<br>Когда-то революционный очаг Гавана привлекала больше, чем справедливая доля туристов, и посетители неизменно оказывались под впечатлением от удивительного искусства и архитектуры города.<br>Живописные улицы Гаваны опьяняют солнцем, ромом и сальсой.

1447,Awesome video. Oregon is an incredibly beautiful state. Proud to be from there.
1448,"Been to all of them, numerous times to several of them and I&#39;ve got to say as a 52 year old Oregon native, that with the numerous amazing places all over this state Portland doesn&#39;t belong anywhere near a top 10, maybe 30-40 years ago it would have but not anymore, a city that has been ran by liberal Democrats many who are FAR left extremist who have done NOTHING for Portland but stir division and destroy a once beautiful city. <br>For several years the violent terrorist group antifa has been allowed to terrorize the city at will and with no repercussions or consequences, on the rare occasion that one of these worthless slimeballs is arrested, they are released with charges dropped by a RADICAL leftist District Attorney, who in no way operates like he should by applying EQUAL JUSTICE UNDER THE LAW!! A God given right guaranteed by the Constitution!<br>If anyone tries to claim that the DA is fair, you are either all out lying, know none of the well known facts, or just stupid.<br>Portland AKA Anquifastan!<br>The streets, parks, bike paths, greenways,freeways,business areas are OVERRUN with homeless junkies who leave dirty syringes and defecate everywhere, they build GIANT biohazard, drug and crime infested 3rd world slum city&#39;s that cost astronomical amounts to clean up, just for them to be allowed to do it over and over!<br>You can save the &quot;we just need more housing for these poor little victims&quot;, because the vast majority of homeless in Portland refuse services to get them off the streets, because the have to stop being JUNKIES!! Programs make you stop using, which means they&#39;ve made the decision to be a homeless junkie, and all of this is done in the name of liberal &quot;compassion&quot;, just drive around Portland and ask yourself if what you see resembles compassion in any way?<br>Portland PD is horribly shorthanded and only getting worse.<br>All drugs have been essentially decriminalized. <br>Crime is out of control, from murder on down, crimes like shoplifting for the most part aren&#39;t being charged, criminals arrested for some very serious crimes like Arson, Assault, Riot, etc, if even charged are QUICKLY released from custody,  well unless you&#39;re a Conservative, or Republican, or Libertarian, or a President Trump  or President Reagan supporter, or a Patriot of ANY color, they will throw the book at you and keep you locked up as long as they can.<br>Most people who work in the Portland area can&#39;t afford to live there.<br>Portland is well on it&#39;s way like Seattle to being our west coast  Detroit/Baltimore/Chicago like cesspools, that liberal ran cities always degrade into."

Есть много прекрасных музеев и галерей, исторических статуй и прекрасных зеленых парков. Посетители могут делать покупки, пока они не упадут в крытой галерее 19-го века. И, наконец, что не менее важно, гурманы смогут насладиться гастрономическими изысками города, в том числе знаменитыми бельгийскими шоколадными конфетами."

1552,"Столица итальянского региона Тоскана, Флоренция пользуется международным признанием благодаря высокой концентрации искусства и архитектуры эпохи Возрождения. Поскольку он служил богатым и важным центром средневековой торговли и коммерции, город породил движение итальянского Возрождения. Флоренции также приписывают пропаганду многих художников, изобретателей, писателей, ученых и исследователей, а также изобретения оперы и флоринской валюты, которая вывела Европу из темных веков.<br>Имитируя один огромный музей под открытым небом, город Флоренция привлекает миллионы туристов каждый год. Ходьба - лучший способ увидеть основные достопримечательности в центре города. Некоторые из лучших мест для прогулок включают Понте Веккьо, красивый мост через реку Арно, в котором есть несколько ювелирных магазинов высокого класса.

1695,I advise everyone not to go on holiday to Portugal. Portugal requires a PCR test made at least 72 hours before departure. Such a PCR test costs the ridiculous amount of 100 euro per person. This makes holidays to Portugal unaffordable!

The food is seriously disgusting, no taste, no flavours, just crap all around. I would never travel to Istanbul or Turkey for that matter. The people are rude and arrogant. I would strongly advise to travel elsewhere. Istanbul is a rip off and I will never be travelling to Turkey again. The country is backwards!"

1758,"&quot;Warsaw suffered from German bombs&quot;?? Sounds like not funny joke. Warsaw was literally wiped out from the map. Following the Warsaw Uprising, Hitler personally ordered the complete demolition of Warsaw and the murder of all Warsaw residents, so that it was a warning to other European capital cities not to oppose the Nazi regime. The order was executed, so that approx. 90-95% of Warsaw buildings and infrastructure were blown to the ground by Germans and their allies. Himmler also justified the destruction of Warsaw as &quot;the final solution&quot; for the Polish nation, culture, tought,hub of communication and the centre of power of the &quot;eternal competitor&quot; and enemy of Germany and German people. Don&#39;t believe me, just do the homework and your own research, during WW II there was also the Polish genocide... not only Jewish. Although the video is generally positive, some statements are, to put it mildly, tactless and ignorant."

1769,"To say that Warsaw &quot;suffered heavy damage from German bombs in World War II&quot; is quite misleading. While some bombs early on damaged a little bit of teh city. after the Warsaw Uprising in 1944, German troops systematically destroyed about 85% of the city by blowing up the buildings.  It was Hitler&#39;s attempt to permanently wipe Warsaw off the face of the Earth. Let&#39;s be accurate...."
1770,"На протяжении веков Варшава была разграблена и неоднократно захвачена войсками из Швеции и Франции в Россию. Она получила тяжелый урон от немецких бомб во время Второй мировой войны. Тем не менее, Варшава сегодня - это новый динамичный город, который был в значительной степени восстановлен до Второй мировой войны. Среди туристических достопримечательностей Варшавы нельзя пропустить Старый город с его дворцом, церквями и замками. Посетители также захотят воспользоваться впечатляющими культурными мероприятиями города. Вот посмотрите на основные туристические достопримечательности в Варшаве"

1818,I&#39;m coming to France soon😍😍
1819,A great country
1820,France is the descendants of Cain in my own research
1821,French people are strange. I&#39;m not enjoying my stay here.
1822,"I want to visit France with my husband I hope very soon he will manage to call us in France ,,pray for me"
1823,To drink wine in France is like tasting a one-of-a-kind drink; the country is also indeed brimming with beautiful attractions and adventures to hop in. Alsace region is also an excellent destination to explore in France.
1824,"Wish you everybody a true Rennaissance spirit for the Christmas celebrations, the best  Santa Claus&#39;s gifts fans, trips abroad"

1828,"The Eifel Tower is the symbol of Paris and of France, but it is extremely ugly, the Parisians wanted this symbol to be taken away after the International Exhibition, so Mr. Eifel hid up there in the tower so that they wouldn&#39;t tear down this scaffolding, he is probably still up there, having fun."
1829,Am high phobic so I probably rather not pass through the bridge
1830,France cannot be replaced by any other country but France<br><br>France is France itself
1831,"&quot;Who has the bad speech, his luck shall be bad&quot;"

1926,San Francisco sucks now. It&#39;s pure trash and of course the video didn&#39;t show the bums and turds everywhere. Food is overpriced and too many people there. I live close to sf but avoid it. I&#39;ve been there maybe twice in 3 years for a reason. Better off going through Alameda and grabbing food or west oakland to hangout. Sf is a dump

1954,Has anyone picked up “Storytelling With Data: Let’s Practice”? I was wondering which one to get or if it’s worth having both
1955,That was the best sponsorship video section i have ever seen. Nice
1956,Love all the 5 steps you laid out. I recently had an interview and applied step 4 on the visualization part. <br><br>Can&#39;t thank you enough for this (timely) video! Looking forward to more content like this!
1957,"Morning brew asking for lot of unnecessary details on signup, I quit, why do they want to know your postal code, where do you work,for a newsletter? Are they harvesting my information? I’m not signing up, my condition, email should be enough for newsletter otherwise it’s suspicious"
1958,Wowww
1959,Can someone suggest me the best book for python for beginners
1960,"Power BI is doing great💖 This was a great review, thank you!"
1961,"Hey Luke, there’s another (from the same author) book called “Storytelling with data: let’s practice” The author says that it works like a companion guide with the original book ( the one that you mentioned on the video). So I think it’s a great idea to read both books at the same time."
1962,i&#39;m sorry but all the concepts shown in this book are basics...
1963,Thank you
1964,thanks Luke! What an instructive video!
1965,Thanks for the recommendation. I bought the book yesterday morning from Amazon (with your link ;) of course ) and got it the same day. I am about 30 pages in and I am loving it!
1966,This is great!
1967,"I am currently studying to be a data analyst with no background in data at all. I was recommended this book and I am over halfway through so far. It is absolutely fantastic! It really helped me to organize and rethink the way I think about data which lowered my stress levels as I was overwhelmed with the learning process. I have also bought the companion book, which has excercies, and I will be reading it after I finish the current one."
1968,Hey Luke. Awesome video! Can you make a video on how to use data analytics for Crypto markets?
1969,Dood-bro lol
1970,"Thank you Luke for sharing and telling! This is awesome. You are way much better than some presentors in YouTube. This is simple, clear and clean and on-point. I am interested in buying that book. Ill save some to buy that.🙂🙂🙂"
1971,Five-step approach in communicating with data:<br><br><br>1. understanding the Importance of context: (who you are communicating to what you want your audience to do and how can data help make that point)<br><br>2. Choose an effective visual: (about 80% of the visuals used are either a bar chart or a line chart: you can more easily see their relative values compared to each other and also how they&#39;re trending over time and which one&#39;s on top and which one&#39;s on bottom)<br><br><br>3. Remove Cluttering: () <br><br><br>4.Focus your audience&#39;s attention (size + color)<br><br><br>5. Use words and titles:

I’m thinking on taking a sql course and later one on power bi. Would you recommend anything else? Right know I only use basic excel (tables and pivot tables)"
1974,"can other languages like c# (.Net), c++, java or even javascript be used instead of python?"
1975,LOL I had to learn microsoft access for my college class
1976,"Really interesting video, thanks for this.<br>While my job isn&#39;t in IT I do have a continuing interest and have produced an Access database search tool that my work uses. The tool also used custom VBA functions within the SQL query itself (MS allows you to insert pre-defined VBA functions (that e.g. take in and return values) within the query). Can someone tell me if other SQL editor environments allow something similar, where a custom function in a connected programming language, can be inserted into the query? This really opens up SQL immensely as a tool."
1977,"Absolutely amazing, you&#39;re one of the top channels that I visit for information regarding data analytics, keep up the great work Luke!"
1978,"Hi Luke, I have a questions, so I&#39;m currently looking for a job I just graduated with my bachelors in Finance &amp; Accounting. I&#39;m looking into the position of Financial Analyst. Should I try to learn SQL, Tableau, Power BI, Excel or Python? Or a combination of all of these? Thanks!"

1980,Round these parts S.Q.L is the preferred enunciation. Also data not data.

1983,S-Q-L
1984,"Amazing explanation Luke ! :D , happy to see my name appear in the list of your subscribers"
1985,"Lol, the IT guys and their servers ..."
1986,"I don&#39;t get why you need SQL if you work with data analytics software (Power BI, etc.)? These tools build SQL for you automatically. Been doing Power BI for living for years. Never used a single SQL statement except a few very special cases."
1987,"Setting up the feed for splunk or tableau is kind of a one shot deal, then it becomes those technologies you have to learn."
1988,"Hey Luke, this is another brilliant piece of content. So easy to follow and more importantly, To Learn! After watching it it&#39;s so much easier understanding the whole process, so thank you very much!<br><br>- would like to sugeest one thing, would you be able to do one similar, teaching about APIs? I have no clue and wuld be a plus to complement this video. Always wanted to understand how writing a piece of code, and how that runs live or constantly, and how it connects to an API nad how then it connects and links with databases etc etc (my mind is very complex now and I have no clue but wuld want to learn more about it). I think I have seen most fo your videos, sorry if you already did one about this but I don&#39;t remember.<br><br>All the best and a great 2022"
1989,I also forgot to comment that’s a lot of data! Like at least 3 🧐
1990,I just started getting into the learning curve of becoming a data analyst and your videos have been super helpful❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
1991,Data Nerds!  What&#39;s your biggest issue with working as a data analyst? (or even learning to be one?)
1992,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAuuqdzC_rI&amp;t=03m43s"">03:43</a> &quot;I do think that you have to have a high enough salary in order to support your lifestyle&quot;<br>Real world translation...<br>--&gt; The salary you (are fortunate to?) receive DETERMINES your lifestyle!<br>--&gt; &#39;Levelling up&#39;, experience and lady luck are the primary determinants, with luck being the most important (frequently trumps experience and levelling up, frequently in a particularly unfair manner).<br>Bombshell: the vast, vast majority of working folks in this world are in jobs they do not enjoy.<br>Rule #1: While you sacrifice young/at the beginning, your &#39;real&#39; life is always outside work. Balance is key!"
1993,"since you mentioned the influence of an individual on entry level job I, i guess like in most cases,any job ..you wouldn&#39;t get to have much of opinion or influence mostly it&#39;s you do the job and learn more to develop certain skill set to go further , so yeah that doesn&#39;t apply on data analyst only anyway xD thanks for sharing your insights"
1994,"I&#39;d say your &quot;helping others&quot; section isn&#39;t no specific to data analysts. I&#39;ve been an IT Technician and now I&#39;m a software dev and in during my time in those roles I&#39;ve been asked (to mention a few) excel forumlas, document design, graphic art, 3d modelling, audio recordings / mixing, data analysis, plastering (yes as in wall plastering and yep, no joke), support calls for clients, client training, house calls to staff. I don&#39;t see this as being a negative though, if you can tell people no (when you don&#39;t have the time) and ensure your work is done, then it makes people think your indispensible (that is also a negative, as sometimes it can prevent career development as they don&#39;t want to lose so many skills from that department)."
1995,"Luke - Thank you for putting these amazing contents out there! Like yourself, I became an accidental data analyst. Your experience so valuable to me to understand this field!"
1996,Goddamn that vidéo is spot-on!
1997,I am planning to do my Masters in Business Analytics in the US to get into the field of Data analytics/science. I want to ensure that I get a great job at a decent firm in the US. I will be starting my master&#39;s in Fall 22. What do you suggest I do or divert my focus to for a better chance of landing jobs once I&#39;m in my master&#39;s degree? I have experience as a data analyst for 3 years.
1998,"To be fair, a lot of the problems you mentioned are shared across most jobs."
1999,Really insightful. Interesting point about investigating data before committing to the project. Company I work at makes all staff do &quot;data training&quot; to ensure people understand the importance of where data comes from and how it can be used.  It&#39;s a really big deal! Your videos are really great insights into how &#39;real world&#39; experience feels. Thanks!
2000,Off topic...what are your thoughts on the EdX Harvard Professional Certificate in Data Science? Love your insight and your videos - Cheers!
2001,I want to emphasize something that was not said in the video. <br>Domain Knowledge. <br><br>I was a Mechanical Engineering in manufacturing that switched to data analyst in health insurance. It was one of the most stressful job since I had to learn about the entire healthcare industry and its process. My supervisor told me that the analyst should be the smartest person in the room with the ability to answer all the questions management throws at you. I know that everyone&#39;s experience is different but im just saying what my transition was like. I switched to being a data engineer in manufacturing and never been more happier.
2002,"Got more then just value, I got inspired."
2003,Both of you guys are my biggest inspirations man.
2004,datacazzz
2005,"Hey Luke, I&#39;m now to your channel. I&#39;m currently preparing my exam for database fundamentals. Does data analyst also use EER schematic&#39;s. Also learning SQL is really fun! :)"
2006,"lol.. you forgot &quot;your job is basically just copying code from github, right?&quot; and &quot;can we really trust data sciece, it&#39;s basically just a magic black box, right?&quot;"
2007,I&#39;m having my technical interview for a position in data analytics tomorrow!
2008,"As someone who has been a data analyst at a corporation for almost a decade, I feel you hit the nail on the head with most of this video.  Nice work giving people insight into the job!"
2009,It looks like the salary range excludes senior data analysts. Is this because there are fewer of them and they exist only in bigger companies?
2010,"I hate work as data analyst, but I really like job as data engineer.<br>I hate being constantly with stakeholders in useless meetings... Am introvert, I feel totally drained after those meetings"
2011,"Data Nerds! What skill are you currently working on that is a non-technical skill (I.e. soft skill, analytical skill, domain knowledge)?"
2012,Thanks so much for your video. I see so many videos geared towards Data scientists but not too many for analysts. I graduated Sept 2021 and I’m still looking for jobs but needed some motivation to not lose out on what I learned
2013,thanks luke!!!
2014,"It also useful for me as a beginner of financial analyst,  So gratefull for the video"
2015,Stupid question… why is the sub’s tower covered in polka dots? Wouldn’t that make it stand out more rather then camouflage?
2016,"Hi Luke! I hope you see this... I am wondering if you have any resources for finding projects to practice with and talk about in interviews (like the nutrition one you discussed in this video). I feel like I have the educational background, but am having trouble translating that over to solving applied business problems. I could really use some practice solving problems and testing my knowledge but do not see any online resources for this. If you could point me in the right direction I would be very appreciative. Thank you!"
2017,Thank you
2018,"Fun, easy to follow .Thanks."
2019,"That Data Nerds do have a sense of humor is proven! <br>Also not having a skipping talking face every few seconds, because of an edit was very nice. <br>The visuals were a great touch to bring you point across. <br><br>Thanks, will probably need rewatch this a couple of times. <br><br>Oh and ... I subscribed to your channel"
2020,How did you find your first job in the field?
2021,"I have been looking at a career change. I have about 18 years of retail management experience but before that, I went to college for Computer Information Systems. Back then, I learned programming languages like Pascal, Fortran, and Cobol. I became burned out while I was taking Calculus 2. Mainly because the instructor was more interested in writing a textbook than teaching the class. I want to break away from the retail environment into something that is less physically demanding. My technical skills, I feel are outdated. I have a new Chromebook and this sounds like a viable option for me. I would like to know your opinion since you are currently in the field."
2022,Hey. I don&#39;t go to college and recently heard about the CS boot camp can get me a job after complete the certificate. Is there any recommendation in your mind? I&#39;m interest in data analyst and which boot camp would you recommend.
2023,Thanks luke for your video. I want to start my career as data analyst. I am going to follow what you said.
2024,From one Navy veteran to another - Thanks for posting this awesome video.  You inspired me to get started on the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate mentioned in this video.  Happy “needing”. Cheers!
2025,This video is so good! I am planning on becoming a data analyst this year 2022.
2026,"Excel happens to be still widely used, but the real value comes with R or Python. I honestly, have not conducted an anaylsis in Excel for years. As someone who is now hiring analysts, collaboration and reproducibility are just so much better in R or Python. Feel free ingest excel, but then compute in R or Python, and then output excel. In 2022…. Please, please don’t use MS Excel for analysis. Big red flag for a serious employer if ur showing off excel projects."
2027,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC66RXeTn_4&amp;t=1m26s"">1:26</a> This is my biggest issue. I&#39;ve been doing end-user IT support for years....I really want to &#39;graduate&#39; to a more specialized IT role, but every time I get started doing cert prep for anything , I can&#39;t retain the info...by the time I get to chapter 4 I have no idea what I learned in chapter 1."
2028,"I wish I would found your channel sooner. My Excel and analytical skills earned me a promotion from an Electronics Technician to a Business Analyst.  I&#39;m currently building adhoc and self-serve analytics in Tableau. I&#39;ve completed 3 Python specializations on Coursera. However, I haven&#39;t used Python in a professional setting yet. Wish I would have learned SQL before Python. That&#39;s what I need now to advance to the next level."
2029,Thank you for these resources and road map :). This will help a whole lot so I truly appreciate.
2030,Thank you!
2031,"This is so wild Luke....you basically shared my personal learning roadmap. Started my DA journey in March 2021. Started with Google DA cert, then moved on to UC-Davis SQL Training, then the UC-Davis Tableau specialization. Already had previous working knowledge of Excel. I was able to use these courses to increase my pay by over 50% by quitting teaching and becoming a data analyst. Thank you for the recommendations on what are the best Python courses though, that is my next target. Suppose I can benefit from the Excel course too. Thank you for sharing these. Crazy to see how my own personal journey matched this video. Wish I had this video when I started, I had to compare and contrast on these courses on my own."
2032,i wanna change my job. how long does it take to i am able to get the 1st job? Thanks
2033,"I started in Jan 2022 and I finished the Google data analytics course in abt 12 days I really enjoyed the sql and R part of the course,but they&#39;re just basics which is good for a beginner like me but I&#39;m definitely continuing with your specialization courses.  Thanks alot man"
2034,"How about the course that I take are like Intermediate or advanced, because I focus to master each of my skills, at SQL, Tableau and Python"
2035,"Hey Luke, I&#39;m a Tech Recruiter now (former IT support/sys admin guy), however i may have an opportunity to join my company&#39;s Analytics and Intelligence team as an Analyst. Would you recommend th Google DA cert as my intro into the field?"
2036,Great video and its very helpful! I just wonder do i need to start first with Google Data Analyst and then with other courses?
2037,This guy really told us everything we have to do...respect (and subscribed) :)
2038,Senior always on point love your content. Could you pls help me fine my ground can I do Data Analyst without Database Tech
2039,"Hi mate ! how are you? I have been doing the Microsoft Certified: Data Analyst Associate, Do you think it is the same as google one? Or which is better  from your point of view .<br>Thank you so much"
2040,"If you&#39;re still having hard time finding a job or even just after the google certificate (and a portfolio of 1-2 projects), would freelancing a bit work better than more personal projects? <br>Cause it sounds as if it would be a bit more impressing that you managed to answer clients demands.<br>I&#39;d love your insight about this.<br><br>Overall i like numbers, statistics and data analyzing (amateur level, no certificates), also i love problem solving and making processes more efficient! It seems as if buissnes analyst might be the best option for me. Machine learning and ai might be the next step to think after a few years as buissnes/data analyst, but I don&#39;t think it would work without a degree, at least one haha<br>Thank you for your time :)"
2041,"Hi luke, and again thank you so much for all the informations, i&#39;m  new data nerd  from Montreal and I got my first course via coursera but I have a difficulty about ID Verification, every time they say picture note clear when , any idea? Thanks"
2042,Thx so much for this video! Just started the Data analytics course a few weeks ago and This video has me even more excited!
2043,This is perfect! Thank you so much 🙏. Very clear road map that should keep me busy for a while.
2044,"Hey Luke, firstly thank you for the great contents, I wanted to ask you few questions,<br>1. if I complete my Google analytics course and some other courses on course era and later cancel my subscription, will the finished courses will still be accessible later on?<br>2. As you have gained tons of experience in the field of data analysis, do you think pyspark and ELK stack will also be important skills as a data analyst?"
2045,"Hi, Luke  thank you so much for all advices , after many years as web developer i decide to start new challenge to become data analytics  and i&#39; m gonna  follow all your recommendation   i have a question about excel , is it important for data analytics to learn VBA excel or no?you deserve an oscar for all informations  thank you Luke"
2046,"in addition to learning the tools to perform data analysis, what basic knowledge is very supportive as a data analyst? Math? Stats? Or what? Thanks"
2047,After all doing all these courses your looking at a good amount of time worth of studying . Wondering if it’s worth doing all this work for no degree in return
2048,"If I like python with SQL Excel and power bi, ¿ I can get a job?"
2049,"Hi Luke! Thank you for all your great content. I am about to start a Sales position with an Artificial Intelligence startup. I&#39;d like to learn more about the domain of Data Analytics so I can speak to my customers more intelligently. Do you think the Google Data Analytics Certificate would be worth my time? Or, would it be enough to just stay up to date on all your videos? <br><br>For reference, my degrees are in Engineering and I&#39;ve spent the last 3.5 years in sales with an Internet of Things startup."
2050,Another GREAT informative video brother     Thanks 🙏
2051,Data Nerds! 💻👨🏼‍💻🖥 I&#39;m curious if you have data science jobs that DO or DON&#39;T RELY on a particular OPERATING SYTEM❓
2052,Everybody knows that Linux is the only proper way to go.
2053,"So basically,  the pros for Windows are: it supports everything, it does not need workarounds, and it is cheaper. <br>The pros for Mac are: &quot;I like Apple,  and with a few tricks it can work as well as Windows&quot;<br><br>Got it ;)"
2054,You could setup that your menu bar shows up on fullscreen and set your apps on fullscreen then. This way you maximize your 16“ real estate.
2055,just get an external ssd or use bootcamp
2056,"Hi bro, I am at beginner level and want to learn Ms Excel, Power Bi, SQL &amp; Python. Where to start? &amp; which online platform should i use to learn them?"
2057,Would you recommend a Microsoft Go to get started?
2058,Why settle for less? Get Linux 😂
2059,"Hey, Thanks for the video Luke. I am just starting out to learn data analytics and was thinking of maybe getting a MacBook but this video helped."
2060,Hi. What do you recommend For stata ana spss? The MacBook air continue been your choice..?
2061,"I love that <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4vh2EClJic&amp;t=2m49s"">2:49</a>  &quot;data nerd&quot; has become a unit of measure for this channel 🤣"
2062,How come you don&#39;t have a Apple Watch to complete the Holy Fruit Trinity ?
2063,"No, it doesn&#39;t mean Macs are more likely to be selected for data science. It just means relatively more Mac lover data scientists watch your channel. it&#39;s called selection bias, you can&#39;t compare your poll to a nationally representative survey. Anyhow, still an  interesting video."
2064,"The 2 biggest factors for Windows dominance: Corporate culture and software suport, and the corporate culture ensures that dev companies aways prioritize windows, so its a loop. And from the tools you used as an example, I&#39;d say the only reason you&#39;d use them is corporate culture. SQL Server isn&#39;t a big deal, so is power bi,  but you can&#39;t choose if the company you work for decides for you. I&#39;m not a data analyst though, so maybe I&#39;m wrong."
2065,"Hey Luke, thanks for your videos they’re awesome, just wanted to ask you if you know a way you could recommend or do a video on how set up MSSQL Server working in M1 MacBooks"
2066,&quot;half a data nerd&quot; 😂
2067,"Maybe as a data analyst windows is better, but for data science and engineering, linux and Mac are way better due to ease of installing things with apt and home brew. And the fact that working on the terminal helps you working in the cloud as well!"
2068,Linux all the way. The power of the terminal + the price of a normal PC!
2069,"Poll is biased because more people have windows laptop. If you will adjust for that bias, it will be 1:1. I myself use windows but I think new mac with m1 looks great as per reviews and I might opt for that when looking for my next laptop."
2070,"Some problems are that you polled your audience which may be skewed toward mac. Additionally, you used the general world statistics for your control group. If you audience is predominantly from USA, then the control market share for macos is higher."
2071,Yea but actually no :/ I could only afford the  8gb M1 MacBook air. Aaaaand it heats up and dies on my most intensive tasks.
2072,Yeahh will you deliver to india
2073,Give it to me.
2074,I can buy it. But i can only pay the price of a macbook air at max🤣🤣
2075,It’s all fun and games until tensorflow gets apple silicon support
2076,"Cool. Carry out some more tests 😀 would be helpful for someone like me, who&#39;s planning to buy M1"
2077,How can I test this code on my PC?
2078,"Here a m1 air user, don&#39;t buy it if you are going to do heavy work there. Especially with 8gb of ram, it slows everything down a ton, if you get it, at least get 16gb of ram.<br><br>It also throtles sometimes"
2079,$50!!!
2080,What test did you ran? Was it like generating a sequence? Comparing only CPU? Or was it also drive speed?
2081,Should a person go for 8gb or 16gb varient?
2082,😅👍
2083,Can I buy the Mac?
2084,"Anyone has comments about the ram tho? My 16gb windows laptop is like 90% all the time, also I hate swap."
2085,Run a parallelised code. <br>Serial code will take similar time even on a super commuting cluster
2086,I’m still confused someone please help on choosing the right one for a graphic designer/video production student please
2087,"I&#39;ll buy Your M1 Max for $1,300.00 if You don&#39;t mind   <b>smiles</b> 😊"
2088,I offer 1k for the useless m1 max.
2089,CPython is the master in concurrency
2090,"no the best code in all of history is clearly JS,"
2091,I found your video while looking for a laptop for college as I will be majoring in Data Science. Do you think a MacBook Air 16 RAM/1 TB will be enough or should I get a base model MacBook Pro 14? Or should I wait for the M2 Air?
2092,"I found your video review by chance and my immediate reaction, as someone who frequently needs to do substantial data processing using Excel (and is beyond frustrated with Windows laptop performance), was &quot;at last !&quot;. Trouble is, the Excel section of your review was (paraphrasing) &#39;pretty good, but use a Windows machine is you need some specific functionality&#39;. This tells me almost nothing about the capabilities and relative performance of an M1 Max/Pro, either versus Windows machines, or versus the standard M1 chips. With Excel having such a huge user base I thought you&#39;d cover the performance of this software in far more detail."
2093,"Thank you for your clear and understandable video. This is exactly what I was looking for. Currently I started my job as a data scientist/analyst, and I am considering to get M1 Pro 14 base model w 1TB. What I&#39;m wondering now is if I would ever need to upgrade memory to 32gb. Do you think either 32gb memory or advanced cpu and gpu option is worthy enough to spend about $400 as a rookie in data science? bcs this option isn&#39;t cheap at all it&#39;s so hard to choose;)"
2094,&quot;Max is overkill&quot;.....as I purchase a 17in Razer blade with i9 12th gen 64gb ram and a 3080. When Google Collab would more than suit my needs. 🤣
2095,Found exactly the video that I was looking for. Explained to the point covered everything that i hoped for being a Data Analyst. Thanks for the video. I think I&#39;ll go with M1 13inch pro. Thats more than enough. No point in getting m1 pro and max
2096,"This is 2022. Not sure why YouTubers are even testing laptop GPUs when we have cloud GPUs for free or almost free. Don&#39;t think anyone is going to be training on the Nile River with no WiFi. And people need to stop comparing battery life too. No one has ever needed to work 17 hours straight on a laptop without power. Maybe 8 tops.<br><br>p.s, Rosetta2 ≠ &quot;fully supported&quot;"
2097,"Got a new Macbook Pro 14 base model to start studying data analytics, picking up tomorrow, can’t wait !"
2098,watch this video in 1.25x speed
2099,"A really well-explained video, Thanks!"
2100,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1sQDJSQBUe4&amp;t=15m54s"">15:54</a> :D:D"
2101,Can I use windows most of the time on the base M1 Air 8GB for beginner development/data analytics through Parallels without any issues as if it&#39;s simply a windows laptop?
2102,the ports coming back for the m1 pro is tempting me very much lol
2103,Excellent video! Covered everything nicely.
2104,"Hi Luke, I&#39;m planning to get a macbook but I&#39;m still confused if to get 13&quot; M1 or 14&quot;M1Pro. I&#39;m using VSC, VS, MqSQL, MOngoDB, Adobe XD, premier, illustrator, photoshop and  some jetbrains like webstorm. Would you recommend M1 to handle all these stuff? I&#39;m a budget conscious and M1Pro is bit stiff for me. I appreciate your thoughts and recommendation. Thanks!"
2105,Great breakdown. Sadly all the mac book pros are out of stock for like the next two to three weeks...
2106,What I was looking for. Perfect. You got a sub.
2107,Were you able to get Windows 10 working under Parallels for the M1 Pro or M1 Max systems?  I am under the impression you have to use Windows 11 to work under Parallels on these chips.
2108,SD card slot and HDMI are not PRO they should be standard!! Good video otherwise.
2109,considering they are gonna upgrade to M2 MacBook next Spring.  better wait few months
2110,This was the perfect review for me. Thanks so much!
2111,"Hi Luke, I hope you are doing well.<br>I know that it is motivating for content creators that subscribers share stories, so this is a short version of mine.<br>I am currently a Bioengineering student in Buenos Aires (Arg) and I have always been interested in the world of data science. Thanks to your channel I was able to structure a path to follow in order to combine these two skills and fulfill myself as a professional and a person.<br>Thank you so much for everything !<br>Agustin."
2112,Nice looping! Great content as always
2113,"Hi luke, i just want to ask you about the remote jobs opportunities for data analyst , is it possible for a foreigner (from Algeria) to get a remote data analyst job in the US !!! <br>Thanks for answering"
2114,Where can I get the projects? Any website in specific?
2115,What do u eat in a day?
2116,@Luke Barousse  can i ask you for your opinion about practicum yandex data analyst certificate
2117,you are great one
2118,I dont care if this is an Ad. Cursera is freaking good and is worth it
2119,Today I’m Thankful for your content!!! 🦃🦃🦃
2120,"Hi Luke, One of the things I struggle to grasp is how to use our tools and skills to make recomendations to employers. A lot of the time Employers don&#39;t know what the data means and its our Job to determine what the data means. What&#39;s the best way to learn this skill outside of real world experience? Or is that the only way?"
2121,Just a Short Question: Are your working as a Data Analyst and want to become a Data Scientiest? Or are you just learning Skills Form Data Science to be a Better Data Analyst?<br>I know the skillset is quit similar but was is your Motivation?
2122,Lets start building some basic projects.
2123,hey luke as a starter should i go directly to google data analytics  course can you give road map to me i know mysql and java
2124,"Hi Luke I was wondering is the new m1 Mac mini 16gb good for data ankyst work, are any software or tools you use not working on m1?"
2125,"Great video Luke! :) I also am a big fan of Cousera, as well as Datacamp!"
2126,"Hahaha I feel this! Got my degree in data science, work as a data analyst but trying to learn skills of a data engineer! Think I like the data analyst and engineer part more too! Great video!!"
2127,jajajajajjaja
2128,"Holy hahahahaha now im seeing that im also interested in data engineering, so i guess ill take some courses on both and have a wider experience haha"
2129,"&quot;6 months. Minimum.&quot; This was so insanely accurate, I kind of cried a little"
2130,This is brilliant! Thank you for all of the work you put into the channel because you&#39;ve been a fantastic resource as I continue to work toward transitioning from education to data analytics. You rock sir!
2131,😂😂😂
2132,What the Fu**!!!! LOL
2133,I damn near fell out when you had The data engineer in the closet 😂😂
2134,I love Dags XD
2135,"At least consider Andrew Ng and Fei-fei Li in the frame pictures, the fake data scientist!"
2136,You should def do tech reviews and data course recommendations for people unfamiliar with the field. They would be a blast!
2137,OMG I just saw this HAHAHA I am greatly honoured
2138,Jajaajjaajajaa ❤️
2139,I LIKE the new guy!!!! . . . . . . . buuuuuuut 🤔 . . . . wasn&#39;t there ANOTHER guy locked in the closet? 🙄
2140,"I have done my <a href=""http://b.tech/"">b.tech</a> Mechnical in 2015 but no experience so iam able for data science. Please Help me"
2141,Sorry your not getting anything done without the project manager and business analyst. ☺️
2142,this shit is so funny :((((((((((
2143,"Congrats again on the 100K, Luke! This video cracked me up. The facial expressions killed me. 🤣"
2144,"I like your videos , it&#39;s really amazing and useful to me"
2145,Nice!!!
2146,Where do you usually go to collect data for your data science projects? 👨🏼‍💻📊🤖📈
2147,Hey Hi Luke Add more videos I like your explanation and you are doing nice work.
2148,"Very cool - i actually wanted to download my connections skills for a data science project, but got too busy with work  . . . but i would realy only need a 1-time download, i think?  idk, thanks for reminding me of this project idea anyways!"
2149,Thts amazing.  Motivates me to do the same
2150,You look like the brother of Kalle Hallden
2151,How much time do you put into these projects including the googling and the learning?
2152,Once i used to slow down abit  the script so that i could avoid recapcha
2153,"Some very interesting points around click wraps, etc... Keen to see where you take this one."
2154,I was actually thinking about doing something similar earlier this year and was excited to see that LinkedIn had an API!  Now it&#39;s been too long and they got rid of it which makes me disappointed.  They made that change just this year.
2155,Do you have a WhatsApp bot?
2156,How can I contact you if I want you to <br>A bot for me?
2157,"Funny coincidence… last semester during a project i was also scraping job data for jobs with the search terms: data governance, data culture etc. and i encountered exactly the same issue. Now this video pops up :D"
2158,Is there any site other than google to get a free data analysis course from with certificate ?
2159,This is a great followup to the earlier video. I&#39;d hoped when you posted the previous video you would follow up with information on ethically dealing with the TOS limitations on various sites.  Looking forward to further followup.
2160,Dude you look like DR house
2161,but I still dont know how LinkedIn discovered that you use scraper. maybe you access too frequently ? scroll too fast? or your access is python request?
2162,"The data is publicly available without logging in to LinkedIn. However I noticed certain filter fields like easy apply, and experience level and unavailable."
2163,that was the coolest thing i have ever seen
2164,I saw an &quot;entry level&quot; data analyst job that required 6-8 years experience!
2165,"Thanks for sharing Luke, I am also building my internet scraper to gather house data, hope I do not run into similar banning issues!! 🤞"
2166,"Have you heard of (or even used) this new feature on LinkedIn?<br><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/services"">https://www.linkedin.com/services</a>"
2167,"Could you do a follow up on how to market pricing? I’ve been interested in getting into this on the side, but have always been unsure on pricing depending on the various factors/requirements. Thanks!"
2168,Congratulations on the subs man. Been here for a long time. Can’t wait to watch you explode.
2169,Holy MOLY. <br><br>Competition… oh man… gotta work hard.
2170,Made it to 100k subs!!!!! Congrats! That’s a pretty hefty group of subs!
2171,I can&#39;t see this option in my linkedin app
2172,Damn- This feature will greatly boost LinkedIn&#39;s potential. Epic Short Luke!
2173,What is your DREAM JOB in data science?!? (.....or favorite Mario character... 🤣)
2174,"For data analytics content creators, your videos are the best produced and most objective on YouTube."
2175,Thanks for the video. It is very informative.
2176,"I can&#39;t thank you enough<br><br>I&#39;m kinda still a student, but I&#39;m extremely terrified of the idea &quot;being an adult&quot; and &quot;go to job&quot;<br><br>I really need to understand, and that&#39;s how I find this lovely video of yours<br><br>thanks"
2177,"Nice work Luke, this was orchestrated well and nicely curated by you. I appreciate how you blended the various experiences, topics and trajectory of each participating interviewee."
2178,"Hi Luke, Thanks for this informative video. Can you create more content about data managers or data strategists? It sounds like they do project management for analytics work? I’d be keen to know the skill sets that folks like them need to succeed, the challenges they face, and what they do everyday at work. Thanks again."
2179,Wow pretty concise video. Subscribed.
2180,Thorough and well put. I liked.
2181,"this is very helpful, keep doing the great work mr.luke"
2182,You reference Coursera in multiple videos<br>What&#39;s your take on ther CS BSc via UoL?
2183,This video deserves more views
2184,so basically data scientist in data science is like the full stack engineer in software engineering
2185,So glad I found your channel!
2186,"I started studying data science a few months ago and I realize that now I understand what a data scientist says, I feel like I have passed a step, it&#39;s very satisfying."
2187,"Great insight, appreciate your video."
2188,Very well simplified. Thank you sharing this content
2189,"Thank you for creating this awesome and informative video! I’m about to graduate next month and am still trying to figure out what type of role I wanna work toward, so this was really insightful and encouraging! I appreciate it! 😁"
2190,"Just as a data point (made a throwaway for privacy), I&#39;m an incoming Data Analyst with 1.5 YOE making $100k a year. For aspiring analysts, don&#39;t let salary get in the way if that&#39;s what you want to do. The market wants them."
2191,Great video Luke. I enjoyed it!
2192,"this is a very comprehensive, thank you!"
2193,i depend on you with the m1 pro/max review since are the only one i know who test programming apps
2194,love from india💖
2195,"Hey Luke, cover the macbook m1 max, pleaseeeee"
2196,Hi luke what do you think i have to focus if i want to become an it security and compliance analyst. Please help me because i don’t know where to start.
2197,it&#39;s been 3 weeks since you uploaded this video. hope you are well.
2198,I like where you&#39;re going with this!
2199,How do you look up credible data to import?
2200,Thank you for the recommendations.<br><br>:)
2201,Great video! Can&#39;t wait to for the next part!
2202,So helpful Luke!  Thanks!
2203,"HAHA, what a fun and informative video as usual.<br>Can&#39;t wait to utilise your advice."
2204,Sweet as*! You&#39;re less than 10k subs away from that 6 digit subs! Congrats in advance Luke!
2205,probably my most viewed channel. im very much interested in this and mainly the tools used. so can there be a detailed step-by-step guide on how the tasks are carried out?
2206,Awesome video Luke! Looking forward to seeing the next videos of the series!
2207,I recently made a mistake and got a dataset before I hopped on a plane ride and started to clean the data once the plane took off. I thought it would be a quick and easy Tableau project but I had more questions and needed to look up how to somethings in Tableau. Lesson learned.....
2208,"If you really want to stand out, build a simple pipeline that takes financial statements from your financial regulation agency and put them in a T-SQL database.<br><br>Things you’ll need:<br><br>1. a database hosted locally.<br>2. links to the datasets.<br>3. Python and specially SQLmodel<br>4. Some tool to query the data, either VScode or DataGrip.<br><br>That will show potential employers that you now how to parse and pre process data from the web and do sth good with it."
2209,Thank you Luke. Will be following this series. Currently learning python for analytics after following your channel for some months.
2210,What a great channel for us rare few that enjoy data. I’m working to leave my current job and go get my masters in data science. Wish me luck Luke :)
2211,"Luke&#39;s video pops, <b>grabs popcorn</b> Awesome stuff. Super helpful!"
2212,"Love this channel.  I&#39;m really excited to get back to Data Analytics. I&#39;ve been taking care of my dad (dementia) he is no longer with us. So now back to focusing on the Analytics. I&#39;ve got a background in management, real estate, and government contracting."
2213,"I learned Python before R, and based on my experience, the choice of programming language depends on the type of data objects I am working on. For example, sequence objects like ‘strings’ are very well handled in Python; there’s just so much you can do with it, like with parsing DNA sequences or text files from the web. User-defined functions that contain loops are also not a problem in terms of memory allocation. Python scripting is also used along with the ‘image‘ processing tool FIJI. However,  for manipulating and visualizing tabular data, R is just more elegant for me. I’m still new to R, but I find ‘data frame’ objects more easily accessible and visuals easier to code and just look more stunning in R, plus you can do all sorts of statistical analyses. However, since R uses ‘vectors’, e.g. a string is considered a vector of length 1, I’m just not yet so sure how much you can do with strings or how inefficient it could get as compared with Python."
2214,says the guy wearing a shirt telling you he is/was a marine....
2215,"for a data analyst, R is not enough, R is better"
2216,"I am a python fanboy, but just learn both."
2217,"For some, in data analytics, learning Python may very well be an unneeded distraction, when R is so much more to the point. Learn the one language you need, and learn it well. Google just might have it right here."
2218,BI and such are excellent until it becomes time to share. As being proprietary they gum up the works when attempting to share interactive works. R has excellent visualisation and is open source solving both problems with a web page. Why waste time??
2219,"R is definitely easier to get going with, when compared to Python. Python is less intuitive if you&#39;re not already programming in another language."
2220,I lost you at “data”.
2221,come on python fanboys data analysts mostly do reporting for c level and exactly this is working much better with R libraries than python. ML is not this important here.
2222,Sometimes you say the same things again and again 😟. Overall very informative but editing can be better.
2223,Great objective video!
2224,I love your content!! thank you very much!!!!
2225,"JavaScript is easiest to learn, compared to python, imo. Especially when you write a function with def instead func, thats counter intuitive. Or when there are no braces just tabs to indent code. You accidentally push the code by one space and the entire block doesn&#39;t execute. JS also gives you immediate visual reward by running the code in your browser or just console log it"
2226,Shiny is a big advantage to R over Python.
2227,Thank you Luke for all the good stuff.
2228,There are many entry level DA job just let you do the data validation and SQL part. Don’t worry too much about R/Python. Eventually your job will force you to pick up both lol
2229,Should I learn Python or R for business analyst?
2230,LOL @ &quot;once I understood that R is barbaric&quot; i died laughing
2231,"I once wrote a program in  R and it took 40 minutes to process 200+ CSV files and this was not acceptable.  I re-wrote the program in python and it completed the task in 3 minutes.  I then put R aside and specialized in python.   Be good in one language R/python but really good.  it is better to be good at one language really well than being a master of none :) .  R script is a little simplier than python but  once you get familiar, python is fun and powerful"
2232,What are you doing to showcase your experience?
2233,"I love this video, so inspiring. Thank you Luke."
2234,Did these folks have college degree? S
2235,El Maestro! Bravo!
2236,I have my masters and decided to make a career change  currently doing the Google data analytics certificate and this video helped me out alot was worried when I saw job ads and everyone wants exp and I&#39;m like is this entry level
2237,Loved this video
2238,&quot;I&#39;ve been watching YouTube videos on data science for two years is that enough experience?&quot; 😂
2239,"Ohhhhhhh, you were a submariner office. That explains soooo much lol. I spent 11 years in the Navy (OS1), got my degree in math. I didn&#39;t do an internship so I started off as an assistant PM. Worked my way into the position of a BI analyst. Did great in that role, moved into new position and was able to identify a big issue in my company and solved it for them. This opened me up to my current role doing doing data science thingy&#39;s for our revenue arm. If you can show that you can make money for a company, the sky is the limit. Now I&#39;m like an officer in the Navy and barely work for a living :)"
2240,Your videos are so much useful to people comparing to other viral videos on Youtube! I hope you know that!!
2241,great
2242,Where can I find end to end data science project tutorials?
2243,This was a very valuable video.
2244,Can you do freelance as a Data analyst ?
2245,dude...thanks. subd
2246,"Hey Luke, do you recommend Udacity Data Analysis Nanodegree for learning and creating a portfolio? I’ve seen a lot of people saying that it’s a big opportunity to learn and also create a portfolio and land a job. Thanks!"
2247,nice content
2248,"I really Needed this video, Thanks Luke"
2249,Thanks for putting this together Luke! I didn&#39;t know it was already out!
2250,"Hey Luke! First at all, BIG Thank You for this Awesome content! I am working in a career change from IT Project Management to Data Science-Data Analytics. I was feeling really lost until I found your channel ! it has provide me gold information and guidance about my next steps, this is one of the best content available for sure. If possible I would love to learn from you about the main differences between a data scientist and data analyst (analytics). This is still a bit confusing. Keep it up and again, Thank You!"
2251,I have studied statistic can i become a data scientist ??
2252,Do you have a portfolio website to share? Drop it below 👇🏼
2253,This is a great video.. You have inspired me to pursue Data Analysis.
2254,Great content Luke! I&#39;ll be creating my portfolio website soon!
2255,"I love your video, easily understand. Thank Luke!"
2256,"Oh shit man, I spat out my coffee when I saw you spit out your coke 🤣"
2257,"Your videos are so clear, concise and to the point."
2258,This is great; thank you.
2259,Superb advice 😎
2260,"Hi sir saw your website, very well defined with lots of info.<br>Sir I am using my phone most. And I don&#39;t have laptop currently, so what platform can I download to learn python"
2261,"Very informative, beautiful video especially the WordPress part. Please make a video on WordPress."
2262,"Amazing recommendations, Thank you so much Luke"
2263,"While I agree the upfront time to design a website from scratch is non-trivial, a cleanly designed, template-based, static website generator built from scratch can be a time-saver long-term. The website can serve a dual purpose: a professional-looking on-line presence demonstrating communication skills, and a unified platform to showcase your projects. Additiionally, it is surprisingly easy to deploy a self-hosted, low-resource git server for your domain."
2264,"Спасибо, очень понравилось :)"
2265,I&#39;m building a portfolio in this weekend.
2266,"Amazing website, clean and neat!"
2267,Great Channel man. =)
2268,Awesome! Thanks Luke. Just the info I was looking for!
2269,Right on time! I need this!
2270,"Such a great one, like 99.9% of your videos! Thank you so much:)"
2271,Thanks for all of this information Luke!! I have been working on my portfolio for over a week now and have been struggling to find the right design. Knowing the basics a portfolio website should includes really makes it easier for me to narrow it all down!
2272,DATA NERDS! What project are you currently working on for your portfolio (or job)?
2273,"You never disappoint with your contents, thanks so much Luke! And to your friend too :)"
2274,Brilliant. This is valuable. Thank you 🙏🏾
2275,Thanks Luke. Great content as always
2276,I just discovered this channel now and I want to watch more and more videos from it 😅 thanks a lot for this quality of work! 👏
2277,"Hey Luke,<br>Thanks so much for this video it was really helpful for a self learner like me."
2278,Could you make this vedio as a podcast (like the whole intraction)
2279,Very nice and informative video that clearly outlines how should one go about building your data science portfolio. Thanks for sharing !!
2280,"super helpful for an aspiring &quot;data professional&quot;! (Data analyst or Data scientist or Data engineer, TBD)  Thank you!"
2281,Tai Lopez? 🤣
2282,i have been collecting data of my sets at the gym. i have made a notebook for it. i might end up making a data story for it.
2283,Amazing useful video! Thanks!
2284,Amazing content! You got a new follower :)
2285,"Very Informative video, Thanks"
2286,This is so helpful!
2287,Unfortunately thats not how it works in my country. We apply using system. But the system itself will divide you into categories what jobs you can apply base on your education level and what is your education background
2288,Good resume means nothing if you can&#39;t pass the first round coding challenge.
2289,It&#39;s just pronounced jango the d is silent. Dont want anyone having an awkward moment in their interview when they say da-jango and the interviewer corrects them.
2290,"Excellent video! Highly recommend everyone not just to do projects for jobs but for their own learning experience. At the beginning of this year I wanted to learn to build apps in Shiny and ended up building one to predict how long it will take to learn a piano piece based on its difficulty, length, genre, etc. This was possible because I compiled over 1,200 hours of practice (by piece) in the last 3-4 years so thought Id make use of it. It also taught me how to use APIs to get that data which the titanic dataset doesn’t really teach so yet another point for personal projects😅 Not only that this was always a topic when I interviewed for DS roles but I also submitted it to the R Studio annual contest and won a notable mention. This is not the grand prize or anything but I was competing against full time shiny developers as someone that learnt this on the side for a couple months so was pretty proud of myself lol"
2291,it’s pronounced data not data
2292,Really nice 🤣
2293,that database tragedy tho... freaking real lol
2294,jejejejej
2295,"Dude, I&#39;m currently a Data Science major student, and you are scaring the sht out of me 🤣"
2296,That&#39;s so true !! How could all of this happen exaclty with me? hahahaha
2297,"Damn, when i got this job i expected ay least someproject introduction as your “reality” they just told me, there is the project and we need this for tomorrow"
2298,Nice video...so funny too🤣🤣
2299,Do data analysts also build models as well ? I thought this was something scientists did ?
2300,"um, no comment"
2301,Looking for Alex&#39;s comment
2302,This applies to 99% of other areas in business with 99.99% precision.
2303,I absolutely love your channel. Definitely hitting some pain points in my new role right now lol.
2304,"Module not found, interesting."
2305,It’s so reeeeeaaaaaaaaaaaaal jjajajajaj ❤️
2306,Hahahahahahhahaha!!!!!!!!!!!
2307,&quot;That was so easy to connect&quot; HAHAHHAH
2308,"Are you telling me, that there is not pristine clean data at our fingertips? But, but, but... marketing said...."
2309,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78LMtFItAdw&amp;t=5m17s"">5:17</a> need to pip install first...hahahaha HARD RELATE"
2310,You pretty much describe d every corporate job.
2311,lmao this was so relatable. i spent a whole day once trying to connect to the database and it turns out they hadn&#39;t added me to the file with the credentials
2312,What&#39;s your tactic for staying motivated in your data science journey?
2313,Hooyah!!!
2314,"Broken code, bugs are part of our life. Fortunately you have youtube with kind people sharing tutorials"
2315,I always seem to struggle with the mini celebration part. I keep thinking that the mini celebration is either to small or to big compared to the part of the task i just did. What are some things that you do/use for your mini celebrations. Thanks.
2316,I haven&#39;t even watched the video yet. I simply liked it because of the title. 😅
2317,cs_anal - sounds like a weird Counter Strike map if you ask me.
2318,"What, no power query?"
2319,"Good luck with your journey. I&#39;m gonna take a ML course next semester I have some programming experience, but no experience with python do you have any suggestions?"
2320,"Sir please make a video on Google Data analytics apprenticeship , What it is and what are the benefits."
2321,Great video!
2322,"Hey Luke, can you do one for applying to new data analytics roles and what is the approach needed for them?"
2323,"Hey Luke, I hope you are doing well. I had a question on which you can make a video I guess.<br><br>So the question is, &quot;What is the scope of Analytics? Are we just facing a boom in Analytics and thus it would fade away in say next 10 years or not?&quot; Also would data science jobs would have much relevance or not in the future?<br><br>Thanks for creating this amazing content<br>Keep up the good work!!"
2324,I just listen to 1 hour of David Goggins each morning. STAY HARD.
2325,I smashed that like button 1min before the end!Thanks a lot for the tips and for this kind of motivated videos 👍
2326,thank you for this video
2327,Great<br>You and alex The Analyst are the most helpful YouTuber for me ❤️ keep going 🙏
2328,Yo Luke! Great points! That&#39;s exactly how I tackle when I hit rock bottom in data analysis! Never knew it was the same tactics that the navy/army did too!
2329,Where can I get the panda 🐼 photo?<br>Need it for my teacher
2330,"inspiring,<br>also I think Samurais have somehow same method.<br>They say: in a fight, if your every move is right, winning comes to you by itself.<br>Thanks for video, needed that."
2331,"Great video, I not long ago I have decided to change my career and wish to become data analyst. All topics included in the career have been mentioned and to be fair it has been bit overwhelming. Currently i want to learn python as one of  steps towards becoming data analyst. Would you recommend learning videos/books covering python in general or more targeted info specifically for data science?"
2332,Roll Call!  Are you a recent Google Data Analytics Certificate grad? 🙋🏼‍♂️
2333,"I am basically already a data scientist without the title but trying to get into the tech world. I’m on course 6/8 and have mixed feelings about the certificate but overall think it was great and structured well.<br><br>Did I need the certificate? Not really, I already knew the technical skills the course offered so I’m not sure there is any benefit to me putting it on my resume.<br><br>Is it still worth taking? I think it is great for someone like me who has a degree that is science related but doesn’t have professional business experience. Like the guests mentioned it is heavy on the process and decision making. I learned a lot of buzz words and other information that will help me interview well and definitely helped me develop a solid resume.<br><br>Is this good for someone with no experience? Absolutely. As someone who already analyzes data and constantly creates methodology, I can say the structure of the course is really about getting you used to thinking analytically. It’s also a great intro to technical skills although these alone will not get you a job since it’s a little barebones.<br><br>Do I recommend the certificate? Yes but only if you have motivation. If you are serious about a career in data analytics this is a good precursor to your career you just have to want it and have patience. You aren’t going to want to hear this but this is likely a baby step to getting to that career. You have to continue to develop the technical skills, update your resume, and make a portfolio or git."
2334,Hey I have one year of experience in Machine learning engineering already. Moving to data analyst should I go with IBM and then tableau specialization ? Because python is more easy for me haven&#39;t tried R. After completing both specialization can I get any remote data analyst job as junior ? P.s I have few more questions can I do a personal msg to you ?... last but not the least Stay safe mate  🤍
2335,So one of the worlds largest and richest companies tried to make a free education system to get people jobs and it did bugger all.
2336,Great video
2337,This is a great video Luke where you are asking the right questions that anyone (including me) who wants to take the Google Certificate to get a headstart in DA role.
2338,I wish they would teach Python rather than R
2339,I am in the fifth course
2340,I just got my certificate 2 hours ago now ready to find a job
2341,"I subscribed.  This info is top notch, sir."
2342,Good stuff. Imma keep building my portfolio 💪
2343,Ok this is a really good and informative video thank you
2344,Loved the diverse perspectives! I’d love to hear how Antonio got his internship.
2345,"As for today I am having troubles finding a remote data analyst job, can someone refer me or at least help me with some doubts?"
2346,"Wow this was super useful along with all of your videos on GDA. Thanks for the info, I signed up for the professional certificate and am enjoying it so far 💯<br>You&#39;re doing God&#39;s work👏🏽"
2347,"Realistically, Im one of the unfortunate few that didn’t get a job with this certification. Got the certification, haven’t used it at all. No one wants to give you a chance because you learned this even though you want to show them you can do the job. No connections = no job, no experience. Waste of $45<br><br>Be realistic. If you got the job, doesn’t mean everybody will get it too. Congrats if you did get a job with this."
2348,Love your videos man. Keep up the great work!
2349,Which is the best course for job oprritunities? would love to see a vid on that. Maybe comparing the different courses
2350,"Hey there Luke! I wanna thank you for sharing the knowledge such selflessly, and also wanted to praise you for replying to every comment out there. I’ve been watching your videos for some time. Much respect &amp; love bro!<br><br>I’m a physics dropout, so this means I have only high school certificate. I got interested in Google’s Data Analytics course and IT Automation with Python course. Can I land a remote job or do freelancing with these “certificates”. Will employers take me seriously without college background or experience in corporate world?<br><br>I’m 29, currently jobless and desperate! I can give 12-15 hrs everyday (except weekend) to these courses and can finish them both within 50 days (I’m good with math, attention to details and communication).<br><br>What should be my course of action be? Since you’re a successful Data Analyst, your guidance on this will be highly appreciated and considered. Thank you and God bless! ❤️"
2351,Sir is this only for americans iam from sri lanka and can i get a job after completing this course? please reply🙋‍♂️
2352,Poll time! What field/career are you transitioning into data science from?
2353,is it possible for a non-American data analyst who lives in another country to work for an American company remotely? and thanks for  sharing your great journey and experience
2354,"As always, such an amazing quality and content Luke!"
2355,can you tackle the topic of automating dashboards?
2356,Having social anxity I was wondering if you think this would be a good career change?
2357,Very good and practical advice. I&#39;m looking into transitioning into this field. Thanks!
2358,bro power bi is no data science xD <br>Any business user can build dashboards within few hours
2359,"&quot;Self education&quot; is a necessary &quot;evil&quot; not just in data science but most of I.T. as well. Products / tools and their enhancements are coming out at a lightening pace. And formal education is challenged to keep up. It seems like most courses that are six months to a year old are &quot;outdated&quot; as there are always new and better ways to do things. Online courses and video content do have the flexibility of being quick and easy to produce and update, but it seems like some still need to have an &quot;expiration date&quot; on them."
2360,"Great video Luke! I&#39;m currently on myt path to switch my career from HR Analyst into Data Analyst. I&#39;ve have a background in payroll analytics, and my learning path is focused on Google Data Analytics Certificate, Python, SQL and Tableau. Future looks so promising! Thanks for the inspiration!"
2361,"Ohh man... This video was for me! <br>I worked as a Police officer in São Paulo, Brazil, and in my job, I used to work with datas. I used to make all action&#39;s strategies, where, when, how and what we needed to do to give protection feelings to people, and stop a probably crime or bad behavior.<br>All my data studies to apply the actions were made through Excell Lol... I&#39; ve never imagined that data analysis or science exist... Now, about 1 month I&#39;m though on those, I&#39;ve started python and MySQL studies... And man... I can say it &quot;I love this job, learn and work with it&quot;."
2362,"Dude, badass!"
2363,I salute you sir. You are the man of the man in data profession
2364,This is a really really cool video and I was inspired a lot... do more videos in this way...
2365,Super impressive!
2366,Thank you for putting this out! I think you&#39;re the first Veteran I came across who is doing what you&#39;re doing. This is really beneficial for all Veterans looking to transition in the analytics world.
2367,Working towards a marketing degree do you suggest internships in data analysis or data science?
2368,😂😂😂😂 the interview part
2369,Well done. Nice journey you had buddy 💛<br><br>Can&#39;t wait to begin mine.
2370,"Good stuff!  I transitioned away from biology into clinical data management after learning SQL and SAS.  Now I&#39;m working in a data analytics role in the healthcare industry after learning Python, R, and a bit of Tableau.  It&#39;s all about trying to leverage what you&#39;ve learned from previous positions and applying your domain-specific knowledge when possible."
2371,Too bad Deep Mind and quantum computing will make this particular field obsolete for humans within oh......a decade if things straighten out or on the outside (WAY outside) maybe 50 years.  Fact.
2372,What&#39;s your favorite tool to use?
2373,"Greetings Luke,<br><br>I discovered this video only today.  It&#39;s awesome! Without going into gut-wrenching detail, I&#39;ll just say I have lived some of the nightmares you describe.  VERY frustrating when I know there are MUCH better tools available today than the standard apps loaded on my work laptop.  Anyway, that part of my reality isn&#39;t going to change anytime soon, so I choose to make do the best I can, work smart - rather than hard, and stay focused on developing new data analyst skills that might open a door to an organization that believes in using the proper tool for the job at hand.  <br><br>Thanks again for all of the content you produce and share.<br><br>Cheers!<br>~B~"
2374,"This reminds me of the coronavirus cases going unreported in he UK at the start of the pandemic. They were using Excel, and the amount of data was much greater than Excel could handle."
2375,Thank you.
2376,Trying to explain this to stakeholders who are joined at hip to Excel is such a struggle lol 😂
2377,For large amounts of data Power Query in Excel: compiled folder with over 2000 Excel files and 61 million rows no worries. Just a bit slow xd
2378,"great video! I major in Information System and I have been taught some lessons such as Power BI, C++ and I don&#39;t know how to connect these subjects and how these ones serve my future job. Now I understand better. Thank you very much"
2379,"Give the functional experts (supplier analysts) a self-explanatory BI solution (Tableau/Power BI/ Spotfire, Qlik). Then, centralize the storage of data on a SQL server or Access Database. ETL performed by an Admin. There is no need to complicate. And increase the cost/risk/and reduce the effectiveness of a solution. <br><br><br>The functional experts know how to analyze their data. It’s not the job of programming or self-appointed data scientist. But instead, the technology department performs the ETL function and corrects when the analysts find dirty data."
2380,"Awesome insights for someone like me trying to figure out the data world and it&#39;s tools, thanks"
2381,"I work in gov&#39;t and excel is the go to and if I were to make other departments use SQL instead of excel it would be chaos, because no one uses sql at work or knows it but me. So, I&#39;m surprised by at least the point made in the video around <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TBwY4VjLX8&amp;t=4m28s"">4:28</a>. Honestly though most departments in my agency don&#39;t work with large enough data to really use anything else, so excel makes sense and around here and no one does anything fancy either. Crazy now that I think about it but I suppose you don&#39;t really need to do anything crazy with simple data other than add/multiply and avg."
2382,Have you ever used Airtable? If so what are your thoughts on it?
2383,I am having the same problem with excel. I want to move on to SQL for its limitations even though is a great tool. YOu are doing great content! Thank you!!!!
2384,Some of the challenges you mentioned could be alleviated using validated excel files (using something like eInfoTree software by Cimcon)
2385,Great video as usual mate.
2386,"i struggle with the transition to databases. Working for a large company where everyone just knows Excel, there are data warehouses but there has to be an extremely well documented business need and process to go through with IT to even create tables there. I could always host the database on my local machine, but then my co-workers wouldn&#39;t be able to access them. Tried databases in the cloud environments (Azure, AWS, GCP) but once again, big company requires absolute business need to even create access to these tools. <br><br>Thus, we&#39;re just stuck using Excel as a &#39;database&#39; to connect to consumption tools like Power BI and Tableau. It&#39;s so painful to create this type of change as just an analyst in a large organization."
2387,I remember a university project. I pissed an entire class off. We were doing a class wide project (only like 6 or so students). Everyone did their data cleaning and manipulation in excel. I wrote an entire small Java program to do everything for me that way I could do it all again fairly quickly if the rules of the project needed to change. Turns out the data contained several null values which excel would hide. Meanwhile my program was crashing because of the null values. Three months in and I made the entire class start over because I did something different.
2388,Dude did you work with Dr Isratael?!!
2389,"Me who uses Excel to do basic math instead of the calculator: &quot;What do you mean, everything?&quot;"
2390,"To be honest, if performance is a concern you should consider using Julia instead of Python."
2391,"Hello Luke,<br>First of all, I want to thank you for all of your videos. They&#39;re great. I&#39;m just finishing my degree title in Economics and I want to keep adding some knowledge to my CV. I think Analytics-related stuff is great. <br>A lot of people (and specially here in Argentina) says that a Excel course is a must in everyones carreer. So, as a way to start the path of Data Analytics learning... do you know a course in Excel to be recommended?<br>Thank you!"

2393,"Guys, stop working standing on videos, or companies will remove our chairs. ^^&#39;"
2394,"Great video Luke as always!! thank you for sharing your knowledge<br>I have a problem however if someone has the same: after typing in &quot;git init&quot; the folder doesn&#39;t appear, I tried to unhide it using cmd+shift+.(period) but nothing does. Even by typing in &quot;ls&quot; again, it doesn&#39;t show up on the terminal. What is weird is that when I type in &quot;touch <a href=""http://readme.md/"">README.md</a>&quot; this file indeed appears.<br>Finally when I try to push an existing repo from the command line, it asks for my username and password, but still get the message &quot;fatal: Authentication failed for [repository url]&quot;. I also tried with a personal access token instead but I get the error &quot;fatal: unable to access [repo url] the requested URL returned error: 403&quot;<br>if anyone could me out that&#39;d be much appreciated."
2395,thank you for explaining this!
2396,"Highly recommend oh my zsh for newcomers to command line, easier to see git status and stuff"
2397,Great video. Really good explanation of the topic.

2399,excellent video luke ✔️
2400,Awesome video!! How would you set working directories for reading data on your machine if you have to share your code? Thanks
2401,"Luke, thx for the video!<br>Could you tell, what theme do you use in iTerm2?"
2402,Your tutorial is very easy and essential
2403,"I feel intimidated by all those git commands, so I end up using GitHub Desktop 😂😂😂"
2404,"Thanks Luke, really haven&#39;t understood how Github/Git fit into the whole scheme of things. You answered some questions."
2405,That&#39;s the best explanation that i&#39;ve seen
2406,"Could you make a vid about iterm2?🥺 Cuz I just started learning data analysis and realize there&#39;re lots of differences between iterm2 and general terminal, it&#39;s so cool! Thank you!🙏"
2407,"Hey Luke, stupid question. For the way your screens are setup, do you have a particular docking station? Or is it something you put together on your own? I&#39;m trying to get my work station looking like yours. Mine has wires all over it and looks trashy. Thanks."
2408,back with another amazing video with explanation !! boom
2409,Thanks for the great content! Could you make a windows version? I installed git and it all seems to be working locally but when I try to publish to GitHub it doesn&#39;t work. <br>&gt; git push -u origin master<br>error: src refspec master does not match any<br>error: failed to push some refs to &#39;file path&#39;<br><br>Edit: I tried committing a change and it&#39;s giving me an error where it says no e-mail given and auto-detection is disabled.

Your channel is my go-to-place for tips and course details to help with the Data Analytics that I a currently taking. Many thanks!!"
2414,What makes a good jump a good jump?
2415,Maaan. I wanna ride with you. That looks so dope.
2416,Wow! You know your (python) stuff! Great project! 👍🏾
2417,"Thank you Luke. This was a great idea for building a custom project for Data Analysis in Python.<br>Regarding the recommended Python course, so here&#39;s my situation: <br>I am considering signing up for the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate but I&#39;m aware that it uses R language instead of Python. Now that being said I did take an introductory level 3-credit Python course in the spring semester back in college last year (we even had to do a program to design an obstacle free-path using Matplotlib and Numpy things like that). So that&#39;s my background with Python.<br>If I enroll in the Google Certificate, what course would you recommend for me if wanted to learn data analytics in Python side-by-side?"
2418,how I can change Notebook Theme?
2419,are the gyms open there? I see gains..
2420,Thanks for putting this series together! Super high value and great production. And you gave me a few ideas to make my learning even more interesting.
2421,"Could be interesting to merge those datasets with data pulled from some weather API, so you could cross reference the average number of jumps and how the weather was on each of those weeks."
2422,really intrested ! thank
2423,Really been enjoying your videos!! I’m just about to graduate with a marketing degree and a minor in data analytics and I am aspiring to work in the field. Just need to start building a portfolio. A video on your background and how you transitioned into data analytics would be cool!

2429,Can’t believe I got a shoutout! Love the channel! And the panda pic
2430,"i wonder if you can find any correlations between watch data and jumping. for example a spike in heart rate correlating with jumping etc. <br>The labeling part is gonna be difficult tho. you&#39;d have to start and stop recording every minute or so, so that you know when you jumped. or you could go the Michael reeves way of connecting a button to your bike so you press it while you are in the air.<br><br>Now that I&#39;m thinking about it, a sonar/optical distance sensor attached to the bottom of the bike could do the job. welcome to data science everybody, where you can spend an eternity getting deeper and deeper into a subject :)))"

2453,I&#39;ve been programming since I was 13 and honestly computation is totally language independent even though there&#39;s always  different Paradigm shifts that are always evolving since the days of Fortran.<br>         The truth of the matter is just because there&#39;s different libraries and packages that are already written and all you have to do is just pretend to be a hacker and jump into those libraries and packages and develop some code that is not even likely understood because it hasn&#39;t really been thought out yet or planned it&#39;s just sort of Cobble together.<br>            The truth is the same results can be obtained using Microsoft quick basic so the language platform that the computation is actually performed in &amp; Computation on is actually irrelevant just like anyone could write a thesis using notepad and nobody really needs to use Microsoft Word or Google Docs...<br>            Python will come and go and something else will replace Python and all of its little funny libraries <br>              videos in the future will be doing comparisons on whatever the next flavor of programming language are 10 years from now

2455,🤣🤣🤣🤣 that’s exactly how I imagine R to be lol! I’m a Python fan haha

What do you recommend for someone like me who primarily wants to attain this as an add-on skill from my IT Project Management Roles. Or are there any Leadership centric cources elsewhere that I should look for. Thank You Much."
2480,"My local community college has a data certificate that has SQL Python and Excel. its more expecnsive (not a degree ofc) and is about 4 full college classes, do you guys think thats more valuable than one of these certs?"
2481,"Hi Sir, <br>Thank you so much for this video. In coursera there are specialization course and professional course. I think the specialization course contains a Capstone Project. So, as per your knowledge which one is better? Professional certificate or specialization certificate."
2482,Do you  think the certificate is a good option also for a person who has a degree of Data Science?
2483,Very informative content. This is exactly what I was looking for. Thank you.
2484,"Hey Luke!<br><br>I am sort of perplexed when it comes to choosing either of these… I have just finished the first course on the IBM certificate, but upon seeing several different comparisons with the Google certificate, I honestly don’t know what to do.   <br><br>Which one would recommend for someone that’s just trying to use a very important field (Data Science) as a compliment to a <a href=""http://b.sc/M.Sc"">B.Sc/M.Sc</a> within Business&amp;Economics/Innovation &amp; Industrial Management and why? Hence, not seeking a career strictly within data science. Also, FYI, I live in the EU, not the US (good to know since one main component of googles certificate, is it’s hub of American companies)"
2485,"Is this for beginner, i mean for someone who don&#39;t know anything about or zero knowledge about all ?"
2486,In a lot of your videos you mention Excel is the number 1 requested skill/tech for data analysts in job postings. Do you think it matters that Google teaches Google Sheets over Excel. I know they are similar but Excel seems more advance. So do you think this is a concern?
2487,"Thank you so much I didn’t try this before if I tried this before better then I waste my money to college I should pay $35,000 back to my university I just waste my money but thank you for your advice."
2488,"I dont care, lol. IM GETTING BOTH! I want to learn programming in general and IBM with help with that whereas google more to offer it seems."
2489,"Hello Luke, I have one question.  While doing one graded quiz, I didn&#39;t get the passing marks and no option to retry, Will I still get certificate after completion?"
2490,Should I know how to code before taking the course? If so what resource should I use?
2491,"Hey luke, can I apply for a job after these certificates without a degree??"
2492,It says it recommends finishing the certificate in 6 months but i&#39;m on track to finishing it in around 2 1/2 months. I don&#39;t have a degree and this certificate has made me really excited about my future in data analytics :)
2493,Are you Canadian from your accent?
2494,Is there a list of the 130 companies that accept the Google data analytics certificate? I can’t find it anywhere unless it’s in one of the modules that I haven’t gotten to yet.
2495,one query i have is - better to learn data analytics or data science courses for my own businesses or better to hire/consult a professional?<br>my businesses being<br>a) marketing and tax consultant<br>b) startup app company
2496,I am from India and I&#39;m undergraduate can I take this course to get into the data analyst jobs in india
2497,Totally agree with you mate. 🤝<br><br>The Google certification looks really good as you have the benefit of 130 companies that hire you by having it. And thats probably only the start. Who knows what comes later in future.
2498,"Hi luke, is it a good opportunity to take this certification course without any prior knowledge. I am from a medical background. please let me know. Thanks."
2499,"I have a BS in Math (Stats, emphasis) but haven&#39;t done any work in the field (or any higher math at all) since graduating in 2015. I started the Google Analytics cert today."

2501,Does this course helps to land a job in finance ? Ty
2502,is there any free course for that from any big university
2503,"Thanks so much for your videos, Luke! I&#39;m looking to change my career so this is very useful. Subbed 👍"

2572,Which tool is your favorite? Tableau or Power BI?
2573,is it  both tools are Freeware/open source?
2574,How about ZOHO for data visualization?
2575,"PBI kicks Tableaus butt. Tableau takes 20 times longer to make a dashboard and has MUCH LESS flexibility. DAX in PBI is much more powerful, it can use variables and create calculated tables. PBI also has a nicer data view which helps when doing exploratory data analysis. Tableau also queries the entire database every time you click something which is a total pain to stare at a data loading screen every time I want to add a column. PBI does this all in memory. Plus in Tableau you can&#39;t even change the name of a table column without a crazy work-around that is insane."
2576,Tableau by a mile!
2577,This is probably THE ONLY video on youtube which actually does meaningfully compare these two tools.
2578,Zoho analytics
2579,"If you know one, it is not hard to pick up the other. I have no problem hiring someone who can demonstrate proficiency with tableau, even though we use power BI."
2580,Lol. As BI developer… PBI is the way to go… thank me later 😏
2581,Thank you very much🙏
2582,Lukabrazzi
2583,Both are good but I choose tableau to learn first after I get my first paycheck then I also learn Power BI<br> <br>I like your method<br>Learn it then use it
2584,Love your content. So helpful
2585,"Hi Luke, Thanks for your video. Its much helpful. I work for a media company- TV/Print/OOH/Online and looking for BI software.... we are stuck in deciding between TabClicks Vs. Tableau Vs. Power BI in terms of Coverage, Easiness and Pricing... Can you please suggest your best amongst all three.. Thanks for your kind help"
2586,Subscribed. Good to see your information <br>I am getting into data analysis field 😀
2587,"Microstrategy for the bulk, PowerBI for the rest."
2588,You are a  great teacher!
2589,"I&#39;ve only ever had experience building with Tableau. In my current job, we&#39;re a PowerBI company, but using the tool for prototyping (I don&#39;t do any technical work now). What i seem to come up against is that with PowerBI, calculated measures, especially with moderately sized datasets, seem to make PowerBI dashboards really slow, especially when you&#39;ve got a direct data connection to SQL Server! I never faced this issue with our previous Tableau/Redshift stack. The volume of data we&#39;re dealing with isn&#39;t gargantuan. Our team needs to go down the back-end route to solve certain issues because making a calculated measure would just make the dashboards slow. Am I being biased? Or is Tableau the more suitable tool in this situation?"
2590,Curious why no one knows how to write good software at all.
2591,All the points are explained very nicely and in detail. Thank you so much for this.
2592,Love your healthy way of life and work
2593,"I only recently decided to pursue a career in tech and specifically as a data analyst and I&#39;m looking to do it with an online bootcamp. Hence, I have been watching informative videos about the field and also real people&#39;s experiences like this one. And being an athlete my whole life, I&#39;d like to keep being able to train and stay active. However, some &quot;day in the life&quot; videos I have seen almost make that impossible. Watching your video, though, made me a little positive, hopeful, and inspired for the career! I do have some questions though. How did you get to make it like this, that you can do your work but still also give time for yourself and your hobbies? Did it take too long? Are you also self-employed or something? Hope you respond. Would love to see a video on it too! New here, but love your work man!!"
2594,"to talk about my self , i started university with computer science then i really enjoyed maths so i switched to mathematics but i was not aware that higher level maths is just proofs which i dont like. i just like to deal with numbers. So now i am graduating with general science 3 years degree. can you advice what i can do after graduation in order to be a data analyst like a good pay data analyst. Or is it require to have a 4 year degree ? please let me know i am feeling very stuck right now"
2595,not an offensive comment sorry
2596,you have showed everything except data analysis..do you even work?? lol
2597,This shows that it&#39;s all about organizing your time and following it up.
2598,"How do I get this lifestyle? I sake up at 540am. Clock in at 555 am, sit there until 525pm working the entire time and then repeat."
2599,Awesome 👏
2600,I&#39;m starting in data and definitely approve on riding mountain bikes!
2601,"hello, i am a junior analyst and applied for 150 jobs. i will get a data analyst job soon and curious how my day will be :D. It is a lot of sport there, would be a dream if my company would help me with that. <br>Take care about data pipelines, building dashboards, meeting people, explain stuff to non-techs for 8 hours i expected. For a someone who never has seen and university its a weird feeling to spend the time so much differently is really nice."
2602,Can anybody from another country work in this position?
2603,"Looks like a really cool and fun routine, but I am wondering how many hours you are working every week? Looks like you were only working 5.5 hours that day"
2604,Hey that really doesn&#39;t look even close to my day as a data analyst :-/ Either you are super-efficient in those 5 hours of work or I am doing everything wrong.
2605,"My buddy and I do gravel riding before work, you can just add it to your calendar as a &quot;rolling work sync&quot;. Also, &quot;check email&quot;, don&#39;t you mean check Slack for an hour? ....also, I just joined a CrossFit gym haha"
2606,"Hi, great and very informative video! It is about my boyfriend wnating to be a data scientist. Can i ask you some advice? He has a bachelor degree in business and a master degree in financial counseling. And he finished the 6 month data analyst course at flatiron boot camp before 2 months. the boot camp introduced him a company and the company suggested him a bussiness analyst position of 56000 dollars salary. He wants this position very much.  Im worried that this salary would be too low, considering his background 😭"
2607,Now do day in the life of a submariner
2608,You&#39;re watching TED 😂😂😂😂😂😂 That&#39;s how I decompress. His voice is so calming.
2609,I am a single mother and I should say- you are living the dream daily life!
2610,Do mostly data analysts work from home? I mostly want to work with a sports team as a data analyst.
2611,I have almost no idea what you actually do.
2612,Congratulations on the 700 subs. Amazing video as usual.<br>Also please do a video on Jupyter notebook shortcuts or visualisation tutorials using not so complicated libraries like matplotlib
2613,"Thanks Luke, this is informative. I am Data Scientist from India using 2020 13inch mac pro m1. Can you do a video on how to use dual monitor setup in mac?"
2614,I don’t have a Mac computer
2615,Can you do this same video but for Windows users?
2616,what&#39;s theme are you using in iterm?
2617,"Hey Luke, I have been watching your videos and till now, I was under the impression that you are a relatively famous Youtuber :D Best of luck and full support! I love this video."
2618,Awesome videos! Love your channel. Keep it up. Love to see more tips and tricks for mac(first time user). Planning to buy a MBP 13M1
2619,Love keyboard shortcuts! That’s 8 days of mountain bike riding you could have back!
2620,See I told ya to cover general topics that many will find relatable to and here you are!! This video is about to blow up
2621,Love all videos keep up the work <br>Early gang:
2622,"Thanks! Great, simple method!"
2623,Hi Luke! Which parallels desktop edition to purchase for beginner data analysts?
2624,Thanks! Do you think the Mac gets slower because of Windows (Paralelles)?
2625,"Hello, Luke! Been a while since you posted this video. Im wondering if you have had any issues working with Power BI during this time. Considering buying the M1 Max 32GB 16 version my self, so would been nice with and update on this. Thanks!"
2626,"also have a mac with an M1 wanted to load it but it was there ,,To access this page,you need to be a member of the windows Insider program&#39;&#39; help"
2627,"Hey Luke, Great Video thank you, will download Parallels tonight, Can I also use SQL Server Management Studio inside Windows on Parallels?"
2628,Nice video! Do you keep your data inside the VM? What if you have a small SSD (256gb) and you need to work with an external SSD?
2629,"Hey thanks for the video,  I am considering buying the new Macbook Pro with M1 Pro/Max but I must run Windows on it (because I must use Microsoft Office that runs on Windows, the Office for MacOS doesn&#39;t meet my work requirements which sucks). <br><br>Do you have any troubles using Microsoft Office for Windows that runs through Parallel, on your M1 Mac?<br><br>Thanks, honestly Microsoft Office is the only thing keeping me from pre-ordering the new Mac Pro with M1 Max chip now."
2630,Thank you for this! How can we use SQL on MacOS?
2631,"Super helpful video, now I can use PowerBI on my Mac"
2632,Hi could you please confirm that Parrelel can run the SAP?<br><br>Awaiting response and thanks in advance.
2633,"Hi there!  my old laptop is dead and I need an urgent one.  I thought about buying a Mac book air m1 with 16 gb RAM and 256 gb SSD for university use (taking advantage of the discount) and I am thinking about the possibility of doing a master in &quot;big data and business analytics&quot;.  It is not sure but I wanted to know if it would be ok for that and excel (data base), sql, power BI, access, sap. Or if I should buy a windows pc.  I saw that in a previous video of yours you had compared it to a Dell, but it is more expensive.  Thanks in advance.  🙏"
2634,"Thanks a lol! I was thinking change my air with i3 for a M1 to emulate and use PBI. Thank, thanks"
2635,Is parallels still available?
2636,"Does autoCAD or revit work through parallels? I&#39;m starting school as a civil engineering student, and I would like to know if the m1 mac can run typical engineering programs that usually only work on windows?"
2637,Hello sir i want to do power bi course.  Can you suggest me to have macbook m1 or any other laptop.
2638,"Hi, Mr. Luke, first of all, congratulations of your channel. I&#39;d like to know. Does your mac is 8gb or 16gb ram? whats your opinion about use a Mac with parallels or a windows with 16ram to use power bi related about the performance to de PBI? Thank you!"
2639,"hello sir i&#39;m from india,i am a student of data science so i want to buy a mac m1(8gb ram &amp; 256gb ssd) if i install UTM virtual machine after then i install windows 10 then can i use python,R,Tableu,Power Bi,Ms word ,Ms excel etc windows applications how will it be works ? <br>is UTM virtual machine will be installed on mac m1?"
2640,Is Parallels good for your SSD? I had it open for 6 hours amd it has written 300GB of memory to SSD. I have an 8GB RAM and used a 4GB CPU/GPU on Parallels.
2641,"Hi mate! How are you? I just bought my Dell xps13 9310 and the fun it’s making too much noise, I mean, a lot. Is that normal on Dell’s PC. Another question, how is your Mac M1 working with power BI and SQL ? Is it the same as windows on a pc? I was thinking about to replace my dell for a Mac to use this programs  with a big amount of data.<br>Thank you👍🏻"
2642,Like
2643,you mean i just paid $280 for windows that will to work on Apple WTF
2644,Are you using a 8gb MacBook air M1?
2645,"Love mac hardware, want windows software 😭"
2646,Beersmith as an example!! Are you a homebrewer?
2647,"People say Parallels work better now but something about allocating resources separately just to run a subpar Windows on a $3000 laptop doesn’t sit right with me. And the software is not even free. <br>I really miss Bootcamp, if I had known the new MB didn’t offer it I would’ve not bought it."
2648,Pure gold. Thanks my dude. You got my sub!
2649,"Luke, awesome video overview especially for someone who&#39;s trying to understand how to launch Parallells on Macbook. Now that v17 is available, they support Windows 11 now on Macbook, which is awesome!"
2650,wait what about windows 365
2651,So why not consider a one time purchase of a mini-pc for a couple of hundred bucks and remote into it.  One time expense.
2652,"30 cents per hour doesn&#39;t seem like a lot, until you multiply that by (say) 12 hours per day, 20-30 days per month and it quickly becomes absurd. PLUS MS has said that they will NOT be supporting Windows on M1 Macs. Ever. So you&#39;ll be stuck paying $100 per month for Windows, forever. Unless you, you know, just buy a Windows laptop."
2653,That’s putting garbage in your designer closet
2654,"Does anyone know how to download parallels to an external hd? I am trying to play steam games that are windows based but even though I download to the external, it also downloads all gigs of memory to each game onto parallels which is on my Mac M1 hd. Very frustrating. M1 only has 256gig hd vs 2tb external. Please help!!! :)"
2655,"Hi Luke,  Honestly love your content! Great detail and explained in a simple but effective way. luke I have one question is next year 2022 my joining my Master program in  Business analysis. my question is I&#39;m debating between Mac or Windows laptop do you suggest? I&#39;m so confused right now can you help me out ??"
2656,Coincidentally; I want to install windows to work on POWER BI! ☻ <br>Thank you.
2657,November 2021 and you&#39;re still the only one who managed to explain this whole dilemma to the general public like me. <br>Chapeau 👏👏👏
2658,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6N8n99htvw&amp;t=2m40s"">2:40</a> <br>they said that Windows will be able to run natively <br><br><br>Natively means as one <br>basically meaning replace macOS with Windows with no duel boot <br>unless someone can tell me otherwise I stick by my definition of native"
2659,Thank you so much! I explored crossover today and it doesn’t work. And I don’t want to pay 130+tax for getting a Parallel Desktop just for light use of some productivity apps on Windows. Amazon desktop seems to be a great option!
2660,"In short, Apple sucks and I regret buying the new MacBook with M1. I&#39;ll never buy an Apple product again."
2661,So would you recommend this for data science? or you would just recommend for a content creator role?
2662,May i request how to install Power BI to  M1 Macbook pro? Please step by step.
2663,“And boom there you have it”. Immediately thought of Tipsy Bartender from a couple years back
2664,It&#39;s my dream to have this setup at my home.
2665,"Hey Luke, nice video! What is the stand you&#39;re using for the MacBook?"
2666,"I really love your setup, but i have a question regarding the stand up desk where can I actually find one"
2667,"Hello Luke! I would like to know more about extending 2 displays for M1 Mac. In the video, I saw that you used one Starlink hub USB 3.0 to HDMI (I&#39;m clear with it). But for another display, you used another hub and connect to this display through the HDMI (or DP) port of this hub? Please correct me if I was wrong because I heard that this kind of setup will make them duplicated and finally, M1 will export to one external display only."
2668,"Hi Luke! Would you care to explain your choice of monitors, specs, and why you prefer two side-by-side instead of an ultra wide? Thanks!"
2669,Does your KVM switch allow you to hook up your Mac mouse/keyboard? Do I need anything special to do this?
2670,"Hi, thank you for the video.  Would you also share the information for the stand that combines the two monitors?"
2671,At this point can we just all admit that the reason we prefer dual monitor setups is so that we have a dedicated screen for Stack Overflow?
2672,You ever thought about putting a panel equal to the lowest height you&#39;d lower your desk to cover up the cables?
2673,Very helpful. Which monitors do you use?
2674,Why don&#39;t you get a pet dog !!! Just saying 😂
2675,"Great content, Luke. Keep it up. Was wondering, with multiple monitors in your setup, if you do anything to protect your face/eyes from monitor light? Is it a concern?"
2676,Nice set-up!!! How did you attach those Creative Pebble speakers to the monitors?
2677,Great video! Just subscribed. I was wondering what KVM switch you’re using as I have a similar setup. Thanks mate. 👍😊
2678,Thanks Luke for the StarTech DisplayLink. Game changer!
2679,"Everytime I see WFH, my mind thinks it as WTF initially😂"
2680,"This channel is a good blend between data analytics, humor and, in this case, setup. Congratulations! Regards from argentina"
2681,Setup of the bikes?
2682,I would love to see an update of this video and maybe a tutorial on how to setup two separate environments (rosetta and natively) on a m1 mac
2683,Thanks Luke. Hello from Brazil
2684,Luke I’ve been missing your videos! Can’t wait for you to compare the 16inch base MacBook with the new M1 Mac’s!
2685,"Hi Luke, will you test the upcoming new MacBook air and MacBook pro? I still can&#39;t make up my mind to wait for new one or get the M1 instead."
2686,Any updates in package support?
2687,"Will the python from different soures be different? For example, the python installed by conda and python installed by brew, or by macos terminal directly."
2688,Is 8 gb ram enough?
2689,Do you know if the MacBook Air 8GB is sufficient to build iOS/iPadOS apps? Should I just get the MacBook Pro to take advantage of the fan to keep the CPU cooled down for long sessions?
2690,Can i use flask by installing native python 3.9 natively on m1 ?
2691,Good videos!<br>Have you any information of how STATA works on apple M1?<br>Thanks a lot!
2692,"wish all developing tools get optimized soon ..  ​ @Luke Barousse  what screen(monitor), keyboard, and mouse combo you use in the video"
2693,thanks for sharing! Great to see this kind of testing instead of numerous video editing/benchmark reviews
2694,import timeit<br><br>a = 1<br><br>while a &lt; 100000 :<br>    a+= 1<br>    print(a)<br><br>print (timeit.default_timer())<br><br>does this count as the same loop test ?
2695,I am a new Mac user and windows python user can you show me or make a video to show how you get python to run without Rosanna thank you
2696,Keep at it :)
2697,"Hey Luke, can we get your email for contacting regarding freelance data science job from offshore"
2698,nice job!
2699,"Nice content, looking forward to more .."
2700,"super love. this result is consistent with mine, which runs time series for algo-trading by using pandas and statsmodels. Thank you Luke"
2701,Good content..!!! Can u also check  Visual Studio performance..
2702,"If you&#39;re curious on how the M1 Mac compares to an Intel Mac check out this video:  <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyPm2fOyS7Y"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyPm2fOyS7Y</a>"
2703,"Is this video of an actual software developer elaborating on whether or not buy an m1 mac based on his experience of daily usage instead of doing benchmarks and video editing ? Holy smokes wish there were more people like you, thx for the review man"
2704,thank you very much that was very informative !
2705,"People need to understad that the system will use the ram if it is available there. I have 32gb ram on my windows machine and 16 is utilized. All I am using is browser and some office applications, and pdf. I bought 8gb Macbook Air and it uses less than 8 gb because that&#39;s what the system is given. I can run vs code, run some code, have some office programs<br><br>Having said that,16gb will make your computer future proof. I think 16 should already be the norm. The mobile phones have 6 gb ram nowadays. I am planning to keep my computer for next 3 years,, I think I will manage."
2706,"Thank you so much Luke, you really helped me make my choice"
2707,"Thank you, Luke! How can I run windows version of MS Excel and Power BI on MBA M1? I need to use power query and it looks like it’s not available on Mac’s version of Excel."

2709,"once again you&#39;ve gave direct answer I for exact match question I was wondering about , keep it up, Luke"
2710,thanks bro this helped me decide between the two
2711,Would MacBook Pro 13&#39; will be enough for students who are studying data science in college?
2712,"Hi, thanks for the video. I&#39;ve been wondering - if I purchase the air and upgrade to the 16GB RAM, won&#39;t there be a bottlenecking issue (will the available RAM actually be less than 16GB)?"
2713,Could you please tell me that should I go for MB air (16/512) 8 core GPU or MB pro (16/256). I am beginner in programming and also I&#39;m gonna use it for photo editing and mild video editing.
2714,"Luke.. you should teach other YouTubers how to respect own viewers. I’m shocked for how many questions you answered, big respect and no ego! 🤝"
2715,What would you recommend for computer vision and ml

2721,"What about the high SSD writes?  I’ve been waiting until there’s a 32gb RAM option because of the projected 2 to 3 year lifespan of the SSD.   My logic was less RAM, more swap, more RAM, less swap used."
2722,"I love it! Yes, 1-2 minutes would be perfect."
2723,"You were not kidding about &quot;shorts&quot; :xP , it is way too short. Please make it like 1-2 mins atleast so that its easier to follow"

2726,"Hey Luke ! This video is really helpful. I have a question though. How good is the MAC when it comes to Pyhton Deep Learning such as Image classification, neural networks, etc. ?"
2727,Hello there Mr Barousse.<br>I wanna order a new MacBook with m1 chip. But it&#39;s important for me that I can run Bioinformatics programs specifically GROMACS. Could you please help me and check out that Can I run GROMACS on m1 MacBook?<br>Best regards
2728,Thanks for the video. Any updates on Tableu and Power BI compatibility with the M1? I’m looking to get on for an MSBA starting in January
2729,"What about Stata, R and Python? I&#39;m economics student"
2730,"Hello Luke, could you teach me how to install power bi in M1 Pro &amp; R, tableau, please! thank you so much"
2731,"CE here, just want to clarify… silicon  is pronounced sili-Kin. Sili-Cone is a rubber like plastic.  Silicon vs silicone."
2732,"I am curious if this suggestion has changed at all and what, if any, is changed with the new M1X and the ability to have more than 16GB of RAM in the MacBook Pro now.   My son is in college and he is studying data science and has had a MacBook Pro (Intel) that is around 6 years old and I was debating giving him my 16&quot; Intel MacBook Pro from last year or getting him another computer.   I look at the current AMD/Intel Microsoft Windows laptops but honestly they seem horrible when compared to the new M1X laptops.   I am just curious how significant running Microsoft Windows still is for a Data Scientist in todays world."
2733,I wonder how it compares to an i9 intel mb pro?
2734,"Thank you so much for your Content.<br>I’m beginner of data science course . <br>How do you think MAC M1 suitable for Data science ? <br>( deep learning , machine learning )"
2735,"I pretty enjoy working on the M1 MacBook Pro but I also hate it because the Mac version Excel doesn&#39;t come with the POWER SUITS (query/pivot/map). <br>On the other hand, I like to use XLWINGS to automate some procedures with Python. Due to the fact that different api was called on Windows PC and Mac OS (win32 versus appscript), the way you call each method and attribute are also different. XLWINGS official documentation doesn’t provide a complete tutorial on how to use XLWINGS on Mac OS. <br>Both of these reasons made me turn back to Windows PC."
2736,"I’m data engineer. So I use tools for data viz, data analysis(python, scala) and etc. do u think it’s okay to buy macbook pro m1? Can m1 handle it?"
2737,"Hey Luke..great review..<br>I just want to know which would be the best option for data science .all the software like tableu ,R ,apache spark etc all which are used to learn data science.<br>M1 or intel i5 or ryzen 7"
2738,"I feel like lack of M1 support for Python, Tableau, Power BI, and R Studio makes this not ideal.  Perhaps I don’t understand clearly how Resetto works by mimic-ing an intel chip, but that seems like there’s some virtualization going on which could be another layer of complexity."
2739,you can use parallels on M1 machines to run vm machines and adopt windows features on your research
2740,Hello my irani please add language iran(Persian )  to translate your video tanks 💙💙
2741,"Hi Luke, thanks for uploading this informative video. In terms of some libraries used in python but do not work properly on m1 MacBook. Do you have any issues installing scipy or seaborn under python apple silicon? Thanks."
2742,"This right here. THIS is THE video I was looking for and I absolutely needed.<br>I’m currently an undergraduate Finance student, and I’d also love to learn basics to start diving into Fintech world and build a career. Who knows.<br>I read a lot of negative opinions about the performance of Excel on M1 but no proof. In the end I’m just a beginner. I have trust in what I have just witnessed in this video, perform basic operations and functions with Excel program and light coding is what I need at the moment.<br>The main problem I encounter too often with Windows laptops is the pairing with all my Apple devices – what a pity. Maybe I’ll get one in the future for work, like you did. But for my usage and level, I guess I’ll just need the bare minimum.<br>This video was vital for my definitive choice.<br>I’ll get the MacBook.<br><br>I’ve also just started to give a look at your YT channel. Amazing quality videos, aesthetic and appearance. Very interesting contents.<br><br>Here you go. A new subscriber. Thank you so much for the work you do and the passion you put in it.

2746,Did I miss your mention of Book you recommend?
2747,"Hello Luke, i really enjoy your videos and you really inspired me to learn excel and sql. I got a question, do you need to be proficient in coding to become a data scientist?"
2748,Luke do recommend learning Data Structures and Algorithms + Design Patterns if you&#39;re interested in a data related career?
2749,You look like Mark Zuc when you speaking kk
2750,Django or D-jango

2758,this is exactly how I feel somedays but I keep pushing though I&#39;m in a bootcamp right now so I kinda have to keep plugging away atleast I don&#39;t get that frustrated just kind of down.
2759,This looks like Kalle Halden’s older brother
2760,"Oh Django is a steep learning curse, especially for a beginner!!"
2761,Grt Video.......&amp; I hope you hv got sponsors now.... :)
2762,"Could you share your suggested reading list, please?"
2763,You got yourself a sub. Thanks
2764,"One important thing you didn&#39;t talk about is having a specific field you&#39;re interested in. In my case, I am a geographer and I learned python in relation to spatial data analysis. It helped me keep focused and interested"
2765,"Hey Luke, thanks for all your content, just wanted to leave my message that you are a great motivation for a young Brazilian with seventeen years old, looking to improve every day. Success always."
2766,Just finish this Series. It was very helpful. I have never understand Python this much clearly by any video. Thank you very much. Highly appreciable.
2767,"This is great, thanks you"
2768,"Hi Luke, thanks for this series really enjoyed working through the problems. I have noticed that part 6 doesn&#39;t have a Jupyter notebook for it on Github, any chance it could be shared?"
2769,"I love it, thanks for your help."
2770,Is this series discontinued?
2771,KEEP THIS UP - I love it my man
2772,Hi Luke - I&#39;ve just got to your channel and I&#39;ve already watched more than 10 videos. Its been really helpful please keep this up. Looking forward for more videos from you. Thank you for sharing your knowledge. Kudos to you mate!
2773,Thank you so much I learned python in just 5 videos! I hope I become a data scientist like you
2774,Thanks so much for this! Greetings from Brazil.
2775,Please make more tutorials i love these pls complete the series with other libraries as well
2776,"Congratulations on the first thousand subs. I have a feeling this will escalate!<br><br>By the way, your presentations are uncommonly great for tablet viewing - very clear, legible and concise."
2777,Super helpful!
2778,2nd time subscribing for some reason.
2779,"This is a well made tutorial. I liked the presentation very much.<br>I found that when trying to create a list with numbers from 1-100 using the range function, the correct expression would be range(1,101) since the last number i.e. 101 is not included. <br>range(100) would give you a list from 0 to 99 only, i.e.  0,1,2,3,4,5.....95,96,97,98,99"
2780,"Wow, well done I am going through a lot of Python tutorials but believe me your way of teaching is far better than all of them. Thanks a lot please keep making these tutorials you are doing great job."
2781,Beautifully done!
2782,"Good content, are you planning for pandas and numpy videos?"
2783,"Hello Luke, when I execute the commands to obtain the list of all lines (in your tutorial you run those command at minute  <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnfbVOt9IR0&amp;t=19m35s"">19:35</a>), unfortunately the first line that comes out is from episode 3 (&quot;Good luck. [closes door and locks it]&quot;).   :( :( I tried and tried to understand why, but without success. Where does this issue come from? Thanks in advance..."
2784,great
2785,"Love the way you implement Python to a well-known sitcom, makes learning process much more entertaining.<br>I shall take &quot;Parks and Recreation&quot; script and do some similar stuff in order to sustain new aquired skills.<br>Thank you!"
2786,"Ever since I came across your channel, I&#39;ve become extremely interested in DATA science.  Really great content. Keep it up!. Hoping that your channel grows into something big!!"
2787,"neatly explained, thank u so much"
2788,I didn&#39;t get it when you assigned the previous_item to the item. Can you share how you defined previous_item
2789,Wondering what interface you&#39;re using? It says Jupyter server but it doesnt &#39;look&#39; like JupyterNotebook or JupyterLab.
2790,this helps! very nicely explained. thank you!
2791,Thanks for sharing.
2792,"I&#39;m so glad I ran into your videos, your methodology is great, I&#39;m learning a lot and it&#39;s making me more sure about entering this field! Thanks a lot Luke!"
2793,"Hello Luke, thanks for this tutorial...The ability that you have in explaining these concepts is pure talent! I have one question regarding the &quot;Application&quot; part: when I created my code and then I compared it to your solution, I noticed that I didn&#39;t put the first &quot;else:&quot; (the one under the &quot;Re-enter the name&quot; line), while you have put that &quot;else&quot; instead. Despite this my code worked perfectly. So my question is: is it necessary to put that &quot;else&quot;, or is it rather a matter of &quot;making the code as beautiful, clear and tidy as possible&quot;? Thanks in advance! Regards"
2794,good job
2795,thanks amigo
2796,"I followed through your tutorial while being on jupyter : in <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCN_GRRAoF8&amp;t=9m45s"">9:45</a> it gave me a syntax warning when i wrote ; 1 is 1 !!"
2797,"This was very helpful, thank you!"
2798,Thank you.
2799,thanks really helpful
2800,Hey fellow data nerd! Helpful video.
2801,Thanks for making these videos they&#39;re really helpful to beginners.
2802,"THANK YOU SO MUCH. YOU ARE APPRECIATED ALL OVER THE WORLD! GREETINGS. &quot;Funny&quot; thing: it took me more than two days to complete this tutorial, because I COPIED ALL THE CODES BY MYSELF. I realized what the material was for only at the moment of the exercises, where I told myself: &quot;No, there must be a solution for this long code with all the names of the actors who had a line&quot; LOL. But I don&#39;t regret it at all, because being new to Python I learned a lot by coding by myself!!!  THANK YOU SO MUCH LUKE...MARRY ME"
2803,This video is fantastic totally a great idea to be included in a portfolio
2804,"could you please explain how could jupiter notebook recognise michael_count at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3S_fS4yNA8&amp;t=15m32s"">15:32</a> even this variable wasn&#39;t defined?"
2805,The best part is that you use examples from &quot;the office&quot; which is my favorite serie. Thanks for this knowledge
2806,Amazing video man❤️
2807,"so far im on <del>while loops</del> in python, but i only wanna learn it for data analytics and visualization! Just curious to see if i need to learn advanced math concepts."
2808,"Hi Luke,  have followed many Python basics tutorials in the field of Data Analytics, yours are really among the top out there. You have earned my subscription to your channel. Keep up the good work with your tutorials!"
2809,Very interesting way of teaching by you sir. Loved the way you teach by doing exercises with real examples. Thanks a lot for this videos. And please keep this playlist running.
2810,"Let&#39;s make this series popular, it deserves it!"
2811,"Dude you are a talent!!

2814,"Very hard to find videos in field of data analytics, I would recommend &quot;a day in a life of....&quot;style of video for data analytics to show that this industry is as interesting as any other matured industry"
2815,This is how its done sir..
2816,No idea on how this vid has so low views. Fantastic work
2817,Thank You fr this <br>Its really helpful ✌🏻
2818,I just want to learn this for the office thing
2819,This is the best playlist in all YouTube
2820,"i will watch all ads, thanks for sharing your kowledge."
2821,Great stuff taught in comprehensible way. I want your advice that how to actually retain Pandas or SQL syntax. Should I go through lectures and practice along with it. Or just finish entire module and then take up projects. Since there are too many commands and its really difficult to recall them all the time. I end up wasting time chunk of time in correcting syntax to get desired result. Really difficult to recall exact command/syntax unless going back and forth to documentation. Appreciate your assistance.
2822,thans really hellpful
2823,I. M from sudan do think can i watch this curse and i Learning from it. S
2824,That sunburn though :P<br>Great video Luke. Keep it up!
2825,"Thanks for creating this, looking forward to following along!"
2826,"All I can say is thank God for these  series of videos. But I honestly can&#39;t believe that well into the 21st century, you can&#39;t just open the program and start coding.  It&#39;s like having to walk 5 miles to draw water from a well to take home just to make a cup of tea. Anyway, really appreciate the content, many thanks."
2827,"Hi Luke! I am used to work with R and markdown which has similar code cells and the output below them, however, in R+markdown I can run just the line where my cursor is on even if it is in a code cell using CMD + Enter, instead of the whole code cell. Is there some way I can do that in Jupyter notebooks? I searched a bit and someone suggested I should install a debugger since that is what it is called but I still have no luck in doing this.<br><br>Interesting videos, keep up the good work!"
2828,"thanks for the information, really helpful"
2829,LIKE
2830,what about Spyder?
2831,Thanks very useful video!
2832,this video is gold!! Thank you!!!
2833,Why do you suggest creating a new environment for each new project? Does that mean that you have to install special packages again in that new env?
2834,Cool - thanks!
2835,When i import pandas i always get an error that the module is not recognized.. I want to note that i already installed anaconda and the pandas module but i get the same error. I would appreciate a lot some help
2836,"great series, really helped me understand how to use virtual environments with anaconda and how to use jupyter notebooks within VSCode. Loved the visuals as well"
2837,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuwlySU7Hjg&amp;t=15m32s"">15:32</a> is that control + option + N on Mac?"
2838,"I have a question, when I use jupyter the syntax colours are like dark blue for keywords and operators, dark red for strings,etc. Which is undreadable in dark mode, how can I fix that."
2839,"The video has been really helpful. Your efforts are much appreciated.<br><br>Question: When I try to export the jupyter notebook to pdf in vs code, it always shows an error &quot;Export failed, please check jupyter output panel for further details&quot;.

2840,Thanks luke it was wonderful
2841,"This video was really helpful, your explanations were clear and easy to follow. Thank you very much!"
2842,"Hello friend! I’m student of data science, and use python and R language.<br>I’m from Brazil and followed in your channel, and in your personal site too.<br>Congrats for your explanation! The better was R versus Python!"
2843,"Congratulations on the channel! I have a question, how do you set up the terminal like yours,  when you start typing it autocompletes and suggests you how to finish the script, in light gray?<br>Currently it only works for me by pressing e tab, but not always.<br>I have a mac. Thanks!"
2844,"If you still cannot get Pylint to work after installing and reloading your environment, add the code below to the your user settings.json file...<br><br>ctrl + shift + p <br>Select settings.json<br><br>&quot;python.linting.enabled&quot;: true,<br>&quot;python.linting.pylintEnabled&quot;: true,<br>&quot;python.linting.pylintUseMinimalCheckers&quot;: false,"
2845,Amazing video. Thanks for that. Everything works as you explained except the intellisense  in jupyter notebook that doesn&#39;t seem to work for me. I am using VSCode version 1.54.3.
2846,Fantastic! Keep pumping out more content!
2847,like
2848,"Hello Luke, I am new to programing and want to expand my knowledge. I have followed your previous vids and installed everything correctly. Until this vid. My terminal looks different as you are using a mac. In the previous vids you showed how to do both platforms. Can you please explain how to do it for win 10. I would try to install &quot;conda instal numpy==/1.17&quot; with no luck in the python terminal. the terminal I am using doesn&#39;t generate the &quot;$&quot; symbol for me or have the different colors. Thanks for the help."
2849,"Hi everybody, i have already installed numpy but keep me saying  &quot; ModuleNotFoundError: No module named &#39;numpy&#39; &quot; , if I go to &quot;Run&quot; then &quot;Run without debugging&quot; work just fine .I don&#39;t know why"
2850,"Hey Luke, great videos<br><br>My Terminal looks different than yours (did the same as you regarding installation etc.) but you terminal says 2:python, whereas i can only choose powershell og cmd, how do i get the same option as you, for instance my terminal doesn&#39;t show which virtual environment i am in if i use Powershell or if it is cmd it shows which virtual environment but i can&#39;t use clear for example. <br><br>Is there anyway i can make it like yours?<br><br>Kind regards <br>Jens"
2851,thank you best video I&#39;ve seen so far to explain why and how to set up virtual environment
2852,The blue popup information you create is very distracting. Otherwise a great video!
2853,"Hi Luke. I&#39;m a beginner in this world of programming languages and Data World and your videos are helping me a lot! but i&#39;m having a huge troubles with the virtual environments . I did every single step you did in your videos of installing python, anaconda and VS code. everything seems to be perfect. I write the code to create the new environment and it runs well but... when I try to activate it does nothing. literally  nothing. Don&#39;t put error, does not activate it and I don&#39;t know what to do now"
2854,"Systematically amazing video.. I&#39;ve been watching and practicing every single step (from installing anaconda). I will continue watch this video tomorrow. I am new to python. So I will savour my moment of learning it. Once again, thank you!!"
2855,"Very neat explanation, subscribed!"
2856,"Hey Luke please give me a solution for this, I am using Windows 10<br>from numpy.core._multiarray_umath import (<br>ImportError: DLL load failed: The specified module could not be found."
2857,"This video series was a great help, very much appreciated!"
2858,luke i am stuck here i can all i am seeing here is this conda.io.activation can u help
2859,"Hi Luke Thanks for your great content on youtube. Unfortunately, I have still e problem with the module numpy. I follow your instructions very carefully but if it comes to run the file_<a href=""http://2.py/"">2.py</a> which has includes the numpy command, it seems  hat the venv can’t find such one. Curiously if I change the interpreter in VsCode to base, it all works without any errors. However, I can’t fix the problem if I run the code in the venv1. It occurs this Error: ModuleNotFoundError: No module named &#39;numpy&#39;. It would be great if you or anyone else could help me to fix it. Thanks in advance"
2860,Wow. The explanation is very clear !! Thanks.
2861,"clearly in the topics will have, also, this is what I want! Thanks."
2862,"Luke, this series is so awesome. Been trying to figure out how best to setup anaconda and virtual environments and this is by far the clearest and best guide. I just had two quick Qs: 1) in your terminal and the .py files stuff pops up so you can autocomplete what you are typing; how do I set that up? 2) My terminal is the power shell whereas yours has the environment in parentheses and the dollar sign at the end; how do I get that setup? Thanks again for these amazing videos!"
2863,"Great Job Luke. I&#39;ve been following this playlist and so far its going great. Just one ques though, math code works fine. But, numpy is not working for me. when I tried installing it the output came &#39;already installed&#39;"
2864,"Hi, I asked a question on another post, but then I came here. So, I downloaded anaconda on my Mac, but do I need to add a conda extension to my VS code?"
2865,Amazing work Luke. All you videos have excellent explanation with perfect visualization. Keep on going (y)
2866,hi Jupyter notebook keybord shortcuts won&#39;t work in Vscode
2867,Super excited with your content. Could you please tell me the tools to create YouTube content
2868,I have installed anaconda &amp; python following your last 3 videos. However the &quot;Python: Create New Blank Jupyter Notebook&quot; option is not showing in the VS Code search bar. May i know what could be the problem? Thanks
2869,​ @Luke Barousse  .. I am here.. and a change I use native Python  Interpreter..  btw Thanks.
2870,"Luke, kindly explain. what if you have already installed python but did not add it to the cmd environments path which means you cannot run python from the cmd. Besides what happens if the jupyter notebook code you run doesn&#39;t work as I am experiencing. What could be the reason?"
2871,"Luke, would be great if you create a series or a video about integration with github and building portfolios for beginners. Your videos are great!"
2872,"Bro I installed vs code in linux , and have installed modules like flask,pandas, playsound,,, but every time I run code in vs it gives me import error: module not found,,, please help"
2873,Nice tan :-D
2874,Amazing videos
2875,Thanks for your incredible video it just help me conclude what is the use of anaconda
2876,please stop with those pssshhh intros it actually makes me insane! Really love this series and your content though so thank you so much for the great videos :)
2877,"Hi Luke, I still don&#39;t really understand the pros and cons of using text editors and IDE. I don&#39;t see why we even bother to use text editor when IDE is just like text editor but more convenient, yet a lot of people still use text editor. Why do you think is that?"
2878,These video series are great. Thanks a lot Luke!
2879,"I tried saving the file and then tried opening the same in the terminal. But, it keeps showing [Errno 2]"

2885,Thank you so much. I was trying hard to publish for a month.
2886,I&#39;ve just finished this series you made and can&#39;t wait for the advanced series this year 🎉🎉🎉 Thanks for the informative and easy to learn tutorial
2887,"Hi Luke, your amazing tutorials have made my day because they are so informative and to the point, well done!! Would you also consider to make a bonus part of how to properly clean, pivot, map data using Tableau prep or using any other tools you would recommend (but since this is a Tableau module, so would an advance tutorial in Tableau prep be a good idea)? as people always have to clean their data before analyzing and beginners like me may want to see how the best tools can do the job (More tricky examples is much appreciated haha). So excited to watch all of your other videos and especially your educative contents have all become one of my daily routine to learn as much as I can before I formally start my continuing studies about data analytics in college in September."
2888,This is the most informative YouTube video I have ever watched!
2889,Excellente démo! 👍<br>J&#39;attends tes tutoriels sur les graphiques avancés via Tableau! 😁<br>                          Merci beaucoup Luke! 🙏
2890,"The  worksheet used in Dashboard, you didn&#39;t show how to make them"
2891,Just started learning Tableau and I find this series extremely useful! Thanks for sharing your knowledge
2892,Awesome series with all necessary content about Tableau! Easy to follow for beginners!Thank you so much!
2893,Amazing content.
2894,Just wanted to say that I&#39;ve been working through this whole series and these are all really great. I&#39;ve gone through other Tableau courses that were much longer and not nearly as useful. Thank you!
2895,...............Bravo Luke! 👍👍👍👍👍
2896,"Get this guy some coffee, he keeps calling Trend Lines: Reference Lines.... 🤷🏼‍♂️ On a serious note, I wanted to cover trend lines for this series over reference lines as they are more complex.  Once you understand trend lines, reference lines are super simple to create and you just utilize a value (such as a parameter) to mark a line on your visual.  Try both out!"
2897,"is there a way to make the average line a function of the value? e.g the value i plotted includes negative values, but i want the average line to show the average of its absolute value."
2898,👍👍👍👍<br>  Thanks Luke for this insightful tutorial!                         <br>                 Your tutorials are to-the-point!
2899,"hi!<br>Happy New Year!<br>Thank you for this awesome tutorial! I&#39;m currently learning Tableau and your videos have been ugely helpfull! but i still have some issues with dashboard creation.<br>Maybe can you (or some of your viewers) help me as a Tableau Power User? <br><br>I want to create a &quot;filter like&quot; menu for 5 différents sheets, if user click on the first option i want the sheet X to be visible, if user click the second option, i want to replace the sheet X by the sheet Y...<br>I also want to create some condition on a filter &quot;if filter has selected a single value, show sheet Z, else show sheet W&quot;<br><br>I think all of this can happen in Tableau, but i don&#39;t know &quot;how to make it happen&quot;...<br>Maybe a new video idea?<br>Sorry for bad english skills and greetings from baguetteland!"

2912,Hello Luke how much does freelance dashboard development for SMEs and corporate companies pay?
2913,what up nerds lmao that was great
2914,Hey Luke! Thanks for the video. Are you able to connect to sheets in a shared folder on Google drive or only to sheets in your own folder?
2915,How can i use two data sets independently in a tableau...(dont want to create any join)
2916,"Hey Luke, wonderful vid! I have an issue though. Say I have two separate worksheets. I can&#39;t combine them because then I&#39;ll get the error: &quot;file is too large to be exported&quot;. How do I union these two separate worksheets (as in, how do I join two tables with different connections)?"
2917,What do you use to clean your data on google sheets?
2918,Hey thanks for this! Is it possible to have the data automaically refresh on its own whenever the google sheets is updated?
2919,This was a pretty tough question!! Enjoyed it greatly.
2920,"I have some questions of SQL, how can i get the answers of those. can you make videos on that questions. and how can i send you those questions."
2921,It took me 4 hours of obsession to finally come-up with a code that produces the expected output. Too bad I cannot submit because I cannot afford a subscription plan.
2922,Very good explanation 👌👌..love to see more such videos..maybe some medium level questions 😊
2923,Superb video! I would love to see this same format of video but focusing on a Interview for a Data Analyst position
2924,Is it weird that i want to build my skills and work for strata scratch I love the website . Keep it up guys I’m coming to work for you guys in the future lol
2925,Great! Thanks for the video
2926,Can I have the exact solution of the whole query
2927,So is this channel still belonging to Nate? Im confused. Great video by the way
2928,This kind of video is so helpful thank you!
2929,Hello sir. I just want to say thank you for your video on &quot;The only data science project you need..&#39;&#39;. That was the best direction showing video for me. I&#39;m currently working on the project and it&#39;s half over now. Thank you 😊
2930,Hi everyone! Just wanted to announce that we’ll be expanding our content and producing more videos every month. You’ll be getting videos that cover all aspects of data science from our team. Everyone on our team has industry experience so I know you’ll find the videos educational and interesting. Thanks for watching! And thanks for the support!
2931,I love it👌
2932,"I nailed my sql technical questions (thanks to this channel), but they sprung a python one on me and I bombed it. Having so, so much trouble finding a job as a data science intern. Looking extremely bleak."
2933,Are we supposed to know these pandas functions by heart in the interview or we can look them up ?
2934,"very clear explanantion. Thanks a lot😊.We expect more such awesome videos on Data science, please.."
2935,great
2936,"Hey, nice video and informative <br>Where can i find these type of questions in various difficulty ranges to practice..? Thanks in advance."
2937,"<a href=""about:invalid#zCSafez""></a> I respect the work you put in your videos. I find it truly baffling that all major crypto you-tubers just look at pure wave and completely ignore the bigger narrative of why BTC is pumping and why the future outlook might not be as rosy as it seems. It&#39;s sort of irresponsible to ignore the fact that each ETF launch so far has caused a major dump at the peaks of BTC. We were already on shaky footing with historically low volume and almost pure whale pumps, narrowly avoiding a long-term bear market. this is the worst possible time in history to hodl as so many don&#39;t back up their crypto assets. more emphasis should be put into day trading as it is less affected by the unpredictable nature of the market. I have made over 9 btc with 2.7 btc from day trading with Daniel&#39;s help in few weeks, this is one of the best medium to backup your assets incase it goes bearish.<a href=""about:invalid#zCSafez""></a>You can reach Daniel on ͲeIєɠɾαm👉Danielwrightfx."

2940,"Great video, thanks"
2941,zoom in please...
2942,"Great job, Matt!"
2943,"Can anyone help me , which is the best site to learn the syntax for window functions"
2944,"Hey Nate! Kudos to the great series. You are a good tutor. I have a request, can you please make a playlist for machine learning &amp; statistics with python? It would be extremely helpful."
2945,"Quick question (I&#39;ve just started with sql). From what i learned so far for case when...then ... statement, after the &quot;then&quot;  comes labeling (strings; all examples were using case when for binning). In your code i saw something else (dowlnds.downloads) ...what did you do here? (Is it also a labeling but with a downlds reference, or...?)"
2946,"Hi Nate,  I cannot explain how much appreciation I have to you. Your video is extremely helpful and I have almost watch every single SQL one. All of the questions you explain in a clear way and the platform you built out is also the best. You are my best SQL teacher I want to say. Thank you so much. Keep up making these, we love it."
2947,"Loved this video❤️. Everything is on point! I really liked the optimization techniques using WITH, CASE statements! Looking forward to more videos on SQL. Thanks a ton😊"
2948,"Hello. I prefer to use USING, instead of ON in INNER JOIN string. Do think it&#39;s a good idea?"
2949,great
2950,"Hi Nate, are you sure we can use where clause after group by clause ?  [HAVING vs WHERE: (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30hS-MjpU6E&amp;t=12m48s"">12:48</a>)]"
2951,Super helpful! Thank you!
2952,great content!
2953,"Love this video! I’m at the point where I can get through a lot of the problems, but the code is a mess and way longer than the optimized solution. It’s been a challenge to “think in SQL” to write a better code to begin with."
2954,"great video but as a a rule of thumb run the SQL to see if it works, for example the &#39;where&#39; clause at the last select was left after the &#39;group by&#39; , nonetheless the explanation is great! thanks for the video... cheers"
2955,I think I could apply all this when I write my queries. Good session
2956,"i love this contents, this is so useful to look back our codes! thank you so much Nate !"
2957,In love with your videos. I am enjoying them a lot. Greetings from MX! 😀
2958,"Do we really need “group by date, n_nonpaying, n_paying” in the last query? cte returns data already grouped by date: one row - one date. <br>PS. Surprised that it’s on Hard level. Seems pretty basic."
2959,"I really appreciate your efforts, Nate.<br><br>but please do improve the title of the video according to the question,."
2960,nate you are my best friend
2961,Such a great video!
2962,"This is an amazing video, it is sooooooooooo helpful!! :)"
2963,"I could watch your video whole day long, I learned so much!! Thank you!!"

2965,Hello how i can connect with you i have few questions
2966,"Hi Nate, just noticed free solutions are no longer avaible..."
2967,"Hi Nate, this video is fantastic. I&#39;ve been binging your videos over the past 6 months while prepping for Data Science/Eng roles and I&#39;m happy to say that as of Tuesday I accepted an offer from Facebook :). I refer people to this channel all the time and I believe its the best resource on YouTube for SQL interview prep. Keep the content coming!!"
2968,Just wanted to let you know how much I appreciate your channel and Stratascratch. Best.
2969,Nice hints here. Still training my skills so I can be able to jump into a Data Science role. Looking forward for more content. Thanks!
2970,"Using ranking window function: <br>select title, salary<br>from<br>(<br>    select worker_title title, salary,<br>      dense_rank() over(order by salary desc) sal_rank<br>      from worker w, title t<br>      where w.worker_id = t.worker_ref_id<br>      order by sal_rank<br>) a<br>where a.sal_rank = 1<br>order by title"
2971,Loving this concept! Thanks for going through and explaining some of these common SQL mistakes.
2972,"First of all, I would like to say, I love your chanel and the site (StrataScrach) also. but I like to ask somthing about the block (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bgpp99iz0I0&amp;t=7m15s"">7:15</a>). in your final solution the subquery in the where clase is a nested loop on the dataset without the chance to use a proper index in the query planner I think, but please correct me if I wrong. So if you would use / apply the general rule - filter, aggregate, join in this case finding the max and filter on that condition and join only on those attributes - which is very similar to your first solution, would be better, would not be? :D thanks"
2973,"I have a SQL interview tomorrow for an entry level role. Do you think they will ask about functions like UPDATE, DELETE, etc? I&#39;m not sure how to practice those on sites like StrataScratch and others.<br><br>Do you ask those questions when you interview people?"
2974,"To the point man! When you are in interview even a simple question can be tricky. I was asked a pretty straight forward question in an interview and I gave the ans. Interviewer then asked me how I can optimize the solution. And to me the ans I gave was easiest and fastest. The interviewer was amazing though. She gave quite a few hints. Then I was in a dilemma whether to use a subquery over join for performance. I knew join is better in performance, but just because I could not think of joining the tables optimally at the point I said I think subquery is faster. Needless to say I did not get to hear back from them :( <br>Btw the question is similar to the energy consumption question you asked to Tina in her course. And like you said, the interviewer would not explicitly mention the multiple highest scenario, which you also did not mention in that mock interview and Tina talked through the scenario and prior to that when I had attempted the question on my own I too did not consider the scenario. So yeah this video is most relatable to me... :) Keep posting such great content!"
2975,would you cover regular expressions?
2976,Why didn&#39;t I find this channel sooner!<br>I always love a good SQL challenge.
2977,good content
2978,"Thank you, watching these videos has helped me so much!"
2979,I think this window function below can do the magic too:<br>AVG(monthly_revenue) OVER (ORDER BY month ROWS BETWEEN 2 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW)<br>Let me know your thoughts.
2980,"Hi Nate! <br><br>Another brilliant and informing content as always.<br>Before watching your approach to the problem, I tried to solve it by myself.<br>I had followed the similar approach as your second one, however only difference was that I created two new columns representing the revenues of previous month  and that of two months before respectively by using lag function twice.<br>After watching your solution, I have been made aware of that the fact I could have done with only one line of code.<br><br>I was wondering does it lead to a delay matter in term of optimization if I got solution by applying two lag operation instead of solving it in your way. <br><br><br>Thanks<br>Below you can see my solution. <br><br>with revenues as (<br>select <br>to_char(created_at::date, &#39;YYYY-MM&#39;) as year_month,<br>sum(purchase_amt) as revenue<br>from amazon_purchases<br>where purchase_amt &gt;= 0<br>group by year_month<br>order by year_month)<br><br><br>select <br>year_month,<br>coalesce((revenue+previous_month_avg+two_month_ago_avg)/3,(revenue+previous_month_avg)/2,revenue,0) as rolling_revenue<br>from<br>(select *,<br>lag(revenue, 1) over (order by year_month) as previous_month_avg,<br>lag(revenue, 2) over (order by year_month) as two_month_ago_avg<br>from revenues ) b"
2981,"Hi Nate.<br>Thanks for showing how to use aggregate window function without having to partition based on a column but rather by specifying the rows - it&#39;s super cool!<br>I solved using the lag window function and also using avg window function the way you have applied.<br><br>Here&#39;s my solution using the lag function:<br>with cte1<br>as<br>(<br>-- Extract the year_month from datetime  <br>    select *,<br>       to_char(cast(created_at as date), &#39;YYYY-MM&#39;) as year_month<br>    from amazon_purchases<br>    where purchase_amt &gt; 0<br>),<br>cte2<br>as<br>(<br>-- Calcualte the total revenue for each month<br>    select year_month,<br>       sum(purchase_amt) monthly_revenue<br>       from cte1<br>       group by year_month<br>       order by year_month<br>),<br>cte3<br>as<br>(<br>-- Find the prev_month and prev_to_prev_month revenue for each month<br>    select year_month,monthly_revenue curr_month_revenue,<br>       lag(monthly_revenue, 1, 0.0)  over(order by year_month) prev_month_revenue,<br>       lag(monthly_revenue, 2, 0.0) over(order by year_month)  prev_to_prev_month_revenue<br>    from cte2<br>)<br>-- Finally, calculate the three months rolling average<br>-- Note for first month previous two months revenue is not available<br>-- Note for second month only previous month revenue is available<br>select year_month, <br>    case when prev_to_prev_month_revenue &gt; 0.0 then<br>         (curr_month_revenue + prev_month_revenue + prev_to_prev_month_revenue)/3 <br>         when prev_month_revenue &gt; 0.0 then <br>         (curr_month_revenue + prev_month_revenue)/2 <br>         else curr_month_revenue <br>    end as three_month_rolling_avg<br>from cte3"
2982,"Really good content and also at least for me, really tough question."
2983,loving this
2984,Hi Nate. I was wondering if you were aware of an issue with the website where SQL questions won&#39;t fully load and when you try to run commands the only output is &quot;&#39;tuple&#39; object has no attribute &#39;is_unique&#39;&quot;. Not sure if it&#39;s on my end or sitewide
2985,Awesome !
2986,"Hello sir, I want to buy Lifetime plan. Can you please provide me Discount code"
2987,"Keep it up! I have a possible PayPal contract DE role to prep for, so I will continue to look to your channel for SQL accountability/motivation! :)"
2988,great content
2989,love this series
2990,"Great content Nate as always, but please keep em coming more frequently. Would love to contribute if that helps in releasing the videos faster"
2991,"Hi Nate, <br>I really enjoy your video and the depth of explanation that you provide for every video. I am currently looking to solve medium level of questions and I request you to please cover more questions of medium level.. !<br>Looking forward to your response.<br>Thank you so much...!!"
2992,"Thanks man, you Help Me alot"
2993,"Hey Nate, thanks for your tutorial and it really helps me. Could I ask in the third solution, is it necessary to put an &quot;a&quot; in the subquery just after &quot;)&quot;. I tried the same sql without &quot;a&quot; and there comes an error."
2994,Wonderful!
2995,"Thank you so much, Nate! Your didatic is awesome!"
2996,"Hey Nate, why doesn&#39;t stratascratch support mysql ? I don&#39;t really know postgresql at the moment so I was looking for mysql but could not find it as an option<br>Or do you recommend dropping mySql over postgresql?"
2997,"Wow Nate didn&#39;t know you were from Cornell! Can see it on the wall behind! And as always, really awesome video. My favorite is rank!"
2998,Looks like solution 3 will have edge cases if there are matching salary within multiple depts. I wll also join with deptno
2999,Hi everyone. I am really glad to share that I have just accepted a analytics consultant position at a top consulting and analytics firm in India. A great share of credits for this goes to Stratascratch website and youtube channel. The channel helped me improve my SQL skills by providing me a great collections of interview questions and teaching me how to approach and present your solution to the interviewer.<br><br>Thank you Nate.
3000,Great!! &lt;3
3001,"I think you could also use row_number too, and another approach would be to use cross apply with order by salary desc in it, right ?"
3002,Loved all four solutions and the differences among them. My personal fav would be self-join.
3003,Please make a series on SQL tutorial s it will be great help
3004,Hello I am from India. Do you provide any discount coupon for premium subscription?
3005,"I think that in a way the RANK() version is a tiny bit better just because it scales well in case you&#39;re asked to &quot;implement a tie-breaker&quot; if you end up with two or more employees with the same highest salary.<br><br>You could tell the interviewer that if in the future they decided that they wanted the employee with highest salary and longest tenure from each department, you could just add the hiring date to the ORDER BY clause and you&#39;d resolve the ties (even though we don&#39;t have hiring date on this table, but you get my point!)<br><br>Awesome video! Thanks as always."
3006,"This is very insightful, subscribed!"
3007,"Hey man that&#39;s great, thank you so much to share your knowledge."
3008,Very clear explanation..
3009,"Your explanation is very good sir, appreciate your work 👏👏"
3010,Your way of teaching is simple and easy to understand. I’m learning new things from you.<br><br>Thanks for the teachings.<br>Keep it up.
3011,this is a hard question....
3012,I have doubt that in your output Australia is having same number of comments in both the months means there is no rise so how it should be in the output. Was is necessary to use ranking function?  Instead can we compare the comments?
3013,"Hey Nate, your &quot;created_at &lt;= &#39;2019-12-31&#39;&quot; negates your left join because created_at table is from fb_comments_count and if a record is not in this table, it is null.  But because of your created_at join, you are forcing it to be unable to have nulls"
3014,"Hi Nate. Thanks for your video. I tried the below code to get sum of number of comments for Dec and Jan. But I am getting a different number when compared with yours. For Eg : In USA for Dec and Jan  i am getting 11 and 9 respectively. <br>But for you both months are 11. Confused!!<br><br>select COUNTRY,<br>SUM(CASE WHEN MONTH(created_at)=&#39;12&#39; AND Year(created_at)=&#39;2019&#39; THEN number_of_comments END) as dec_2019,<br>SUM(CASE WHEN MONTH(created_at)=&#39;1&#39; AND Year(created_at)=&#39;2020&#39; THEN number_of_comments END) as Jan_2020<br>from fb_active_users a<br>LEFT JOIN fb_comments_count b<br>ON a.user_id=b.user_id<br>GROUP BY COUNTRY;"
3015,Thanks Nate👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
3016,My man! You deserve an applause. God bless.
3017,"Basically, I&#39;m screwed... :("
3018,"Hi Nate, here&#39;s my solution without left join<br><br>with cte1<br>as<br>(<br>-- for users who have commented get the country details<br>-- extract the month and year from created_at <br>    select c.user_id, <a href=""http://u.country/"">u.country</a>,<br>          extract(YEAR from created_at) as year, <br>          extract(MONTH from created_at) as month,<br>          number_of_comments as comments<br>    from fb_comments_count c, <br>         fb_active_users u<br>    where c.user_id = u.user_id <br>),<br>cte2<br>as<br>(<br>-- for each country find all the comments in dec and jan<br>    select country,<br>    sum(case when month = 12 and year = &#39;2019&#39; then comments else 0 end ) as dec_comments,<br>    sum(case when month = 1 and year = &#39;2020&#39; then comments else 0 end ) as jan_comments<br>    from cte1<br>    group by country<br>    order by country<br>),<br>cte3<br>as<br>(<br>-- rank the each country based on dec comments and jan comments<br>    select country,dec_comments,<br>           dense_rank() over(order by dec_comments desc) dec_rank,<br>           jan_comments,<br>           dense_rank() over(order by jan_comments desc) jan_rank<br>    from cte2<br>    order by country<br>)<br>-- highest number of comments get first rank, second-highest second rank<br>-- lesser rank in Jan means risen in ranking<br>--select country, jan_comments,jan_rank, dec_comments, dec_rank <br>select country<br>from cte3<br>where jan_rank &lt; dec_rank<br>order by country"
3019,"This is much faster and efficient:<br><br>With cte as <br>(<br>select base.*, dense_rank() over(partition by year_month order by total_comments desc) as ranks from<br>(Select country, format(created_at, ‘YYYY-MM) year_month, sum(comments) total_comments<br>From fb_active_users u<br>inner join comments_per_user c<br>On c.user_id = u.user_id and<br>created_at between ‘2019-12-01’ and ‘2020-01-30’<br>Group by country, year_month) base<br>)<br><br>select <a href=""http://cte.country/"">cte.country</a>, ranks, lead(ranks) over (partition by country order by year_month) as next_month_ranks from cte<br>where next_month_ranks  &lt; ranks;"
3020,This explanation is so good. I wish I found this channel a few months earlier!
3021,"Thanks for the walkthrough bro! Key takeaways: Understand data, formulate approach and then write code. BTW you used 2 CTEs which means 2 different joins on the same set of tables. You could have just used the one join along with sum(case when ...) statements to sum up the Dec and Jan comments. Just some food for thought. Cheers!"
3022,Great Explanation Nate. Thanks. Btw I also implemented the solution using group by on &quot;Country&quot; and &quot;Month&quot; and pivoted the table on the month column then used dense_rank() over &quot;December&quot; and &quot;January&quot; to extract the country that improved their ranking. It sounds complex though.😁
3023,you&#39;re the best SQL teacher I ever got!! :O amazing explanations :)
3024,That was AMAZING!
3025,"Dude, you rock!"
3026,"Thanks for this Nate, really helpful. Quick question: is there a reason why you are summing in the window functions? I am assuming each country only has one row"
3027,"​ @Nate at StrataScratch  Hi Nate, I love your videos and they are very helpful, would you also prefer similar videos for python? for those people who prepares data engineer interviews ( like me :) )  would be very useful as well. Thanks for creating amazing content."
3028,"Hello, I&#39;ve been watching this youtube channel a lot and found it really helpful. If you don&#39;t mind me asking a simple question?. Although I saw your video related which kinds of interview questions do DS role has to take, is it quite common to solve normal algorithm coding test (the one that for SWE for usual) for a DS interview? Thank you."
3029,"If you can shoot a video each week, it will be amazing for us. Thanks Nate :)"
3030,"best of the best<br>please, keep going"
3031,May I know how do I prepare well for Product Questions (product management)? Are there any more links/guides on this ?<br><br>Appreciate it ! :)
3032,Where is the Long-term preparation plan (mentioned by Ben) located ?
3033,"Hi sir, is there a chance for people from non-tech field fetch a job as a data scientist? It will be very helpful if you can give few tips about this issue..."
3034,"A two week ago I interviewed for a data scientist intern position (and got a paid internship ;&gt; ). I was immersed in DS and ML for the previous 3-4 months. While learning, I focused most on regression and classification problems. I didn&#39;t have any end-to-end project, but I could still talk about the algorithms I used and the problems I faced and that was the most important thing that helped me pass the recruitment (as confirmed by the interviewer)."
3035,Thanks Nate and all collaborators. These tips are clear and helpful.
3036,Great video
3037,"Videos are helpful, but please increase the volume :) Thanks!"
3038,🐈 so excited!! Mine starts in 6hrs.
3039,"Hi Nate (and everyone else involved!) Loved this video, so informative and can’t wait to see more! a fellow data scientist and small YouTuber here 😊"
3040,Yay!!! Awesome video - loved the collab ❤️
3041,Perfect Thanks 😊 <br>I actually I&#39;m studying data engineer and I have final project and I need someone help me I will be thankful 🙏
3042,This is great!!
3043,"How would you compare internship level interviews and full-time position interviews? Should interns focus more on specific skillsets? I&#39;ve got internship interviews at Facebook coming next month and I&#39;m trying to figure the best way to divide my time. I&#39;m confident in SQL and the technical side, but my product sense and stats are not as strong."
3044,"I really love this video, is a complete guide. I&#39;m a new subscriber!! And the subtitles are the cherry on top. 😄"
3045,Thanks Nate!  This was so much fun to collab on!!!
3046,Thanks for setting this up Nate! It was great to be part of this interview prep video!
3047,I love how you&#39;ve broken down each of these tips in this video. It&#39;s absolutely brilliant! I&#39;m sure it&#39;s super helpful to those who are preparing for their DS interviews!🙌
3048,"First I click like, then I watch"
3049,Your series is amazing! Keep great videos coming :)
3050,Good Job Nate and Others.
3051,Can we use DateAdd function..??
3052,"Hi Nate. INTERVAL is indeed useful for datetime condition statements, thanks!<br>Here&#39;s my solution using the number of days :<br><br>select user_id, sum(comments) as total_comments<br>from<br>(<br>    select user_id, number_of_comments as comments, created_at as date,<br>      (&#39;2020-02-10&#39;::date  - created_at ) as days<br>      from fb_comments_count<br>) a<br>where days &gt;= 0 and days &lt;= 30 <br>group by user_id<br>order by user_id"
3053,"Hi Nate, your content is so helpful. And I started practicing in StrataScratch after watching your videos. Looking forward for your further videos.."
3054,Amazing!
3055,always Great<br>Thank You so much
3056,Hey Can we use datediff function for this?
3057,"Hey Nate, your videos are just too good. I love how your channel is so dedicated towards real word data science. By the way I noticed that you started a video series, &quot;For your Data Science Project&quot; and I really want you to continue making videos for this particular series because there&#39;s literally no one on YouTube with such guidance on DS projects and I have been looking for one since a very long time because I have my placements just after 12 months and I really want to make a full stack data science project. Thank you."
3058,"I realized you are giving solutions in PostgreSQL, not MSSQL, and for few minutes I was thinking are we really able to cast date with::date ? . BTW I loved your way of solving any problem."
3059,Hi Nate...what is the role of nosql in data science? Is it equally important like sql or can be more important in the coming future? Also do you have any upcoming plans to include this part as well on stratascratch for practice just like sql and python.
3060,You’re a lifesaver. You videos are extremely informative and your approach to the problem is second to none. Keep it up Nate. Will love to pick your brain about a thing or two?

3062,"At first glance, I just saw you want to solve an easy question. Nevertheless, in the video, you talked about how to impress an interviewer with a dynamic method. Instead of just showing a solution, you showed how to write a code which can impress interviewer. Really good work, Nate. I look forward to see more good teaching videos from you."
3063,"Greetings, Nate! I really like your videos. Your videos not only teach how to solve problems in more structured ways, but how to keep the interviewer in the loop too while working on the problem. It has helped me in a my interviews."
3064,Laminate and put it on the wall type explanation
3065,Its like i daily learn something new from your videos...
3066,This video is perfect to understand different ranking functions! Thank you
3067,Amazing!
3068,"Hi, are there any different plans for Egypt to subscribe on Stratascratch?"
3069,"Hey! really enjoyed this video, so when we use subqueries and we do the where and select clause, dont we need to do like subquery.rank to access rank and <a href=""http://subquery.events/"">subquery.events</a>? or is it fine to just leave it as rank and events when trying to access the columns (still quite new to sql) thanks! Also are CTES generally just for readability purposes as they dont have any performance benefits of subqueries, correct me if Iam wrong."
3070,"Hi Nate, I really like your all SQL videos. Can you please make few videos on Python as well. Solving same problem?"
3071,I love stratascratch..i almost solved all the free questions on it and i really love the real scenario based questions in it..problem is that its very expensive for me to buy the premium plan..i live in india and currency difference makes it even costlier..i wish stratascratch will have different plans for indian users in future.
3072,"Hi Nate thanks for these amazing videos. I couldn&#39;t solve problems on stratascratch site. Whenever, I click on Question it redirects to blank page. How can I resolve this issue."
3073,Thank you !! keep providing such informative SQL concepts..
3074,I love how methodical you are. I totally stole this for my own approach lol
3075,Thank you for the clean tutorials!! Should&#39;ve much more views considering the quality and information in the channel
3076,Great! I landed a DE Consultant role where my potential client is DoorDash.
3077,"Thank you, Nate!<br>Impressive content, like always."
3078,suppose we can split the dataset into two means then how the query will be ? any one guide me please<br>those 2 tables name was : table_one and table_two
3079,"Thanks a lot! Actually now that you mentioned SQL optimization, a video on generic optimization approach/best practices / thinking will be highly appreciated!"
3080,"Hi Nate, Can we create 100 bucket and choose two for bottom 2% ?"
3081,"Man, your contents are really good! Have got much chance to work on SQL in my current job, need to practice more."
3082,"Thank you, Nate! Could you please clarify the following, I am a little confused on these:<br><br>1. How does the window function work with the group by clause? I have never used a window function with group by. Does the query execute the [SELECT restaurant_id, SUM(order_total) as total_order FROM doordash_delivery GROUP BY retaurant_id] and then assign ntiles to the grouped rows? Or, is something else going on? <br><br>2. Why do you have to do a subquery/CTE instead of using a having clause after group by? I guess this is related to my first question regarding order of operations. Is the ntile part not executed before group by such that it cannot be referenced in a having statement?<br><br>3. This is trivial, but when you used the ntile statement, you did not assign it an alias name. Does it automatically become called &quot;ntile&quot; such that you were able to say ntile=1 in the where statement?"
3083,Really helpful Nate
3084,Your videos are hands down the best resource I have come across so far in answering DS interview questions! Could you also do a series on how to explain advanced SQL functions/concepts?
3085,"Hi Nate, how can we find creation date of jobs from June 2020 to June 2021 in sap bods? I need a SQL query for this?"
3086,"Hi Nate, Your videos are really helpful. Thanks. Can you make a video on &quot; How to transpose variable from rows to columns, using case when and pivot&quot;?"
3087,"Keep up great work, your videos helped me get a pretty good starter job right after uni."
3088,"Thank you for putting these polished tutorials together. Very helpful in preparing for BI, Analyst and DS interviews. Thought I&#39;d share a little bit from my experience:<br><br>A reasonable goal to give yourself is to do at least one technical problem every day. While it will probably be difficult at first, it becomes a lot easier over time. For anyone studying for these interviews I can&#39;t stress how important repetition is. if you&#39;re new to sql or even just coding/scripting: at first it will seem like every sql question is novel and requires very specific knowledge but over time you will see that there are a limited number of &#39;tricks&#39; that can solve &gt;80% of these interview questions. Additionally, I also recommend that if you incorrectly solve a problem that you run through your incorrect solution one step at a time until you figure out exactly why your query fails. Otherwise you&#39;re setting yourself up to make the same mistake later. Lastly, if you screw up in the interview try your best to actually LISTEN to the interviewer and demonstrate that you understand their feedback. Please don&#39;t just pack it in when you make one mistake: no one wants to work with someone who can&#39;t/wont listen, and if you can respond to feedback/hints in a productive manner it might even mean more to the interviewer than a flawless solution. Hope this is helpful."
3089,why we are not doing NITILE(50) over(partition by sum(order_total)  asc) instead ?
3090,Great video
3091,"thanks for the website, thanks for the content, its all a great help! providing free eduction is a noble work."
3092,"Thank you , it’s so clear !"
3093,"Great explanation. Excuse my question, What is &#39;interval&#39; for?"
3094,Always The Best
3095,Would the DATEADD() function work here as well?
3096,"Please let me know if I can use datediff(Month,transaction_start_date,Getdate()) for 10months. We can filter the output on 10?"
3097,i never communicated when i solved questions like this thx
3098,"Nice example. I was wondering if we need the signups table, the signups ID is already in the transactions table and we are not getting anything unique from the signups."
3099,"Hey I see many videos in the playlist are deleted, or may be we are not able to view it could you please look into it  @Nate ?"
3100,Great content. This is really helpful. Thank you Nate.
3101,"I really love your framework to tackle SQL live coding interview. I just interviewed with Uber for a SQL question, but what i did not realized is that I was not able to preview the dataset like I usually did on the platform, so I was panic and did not fully understand the question and gave wrong answer... should have watched this viz earlier lol"
3102,Thanks for This Series  I&#39;m newbie to SQL Queries &amp;  this gonna help me a lot. Thank you
3103,"where t.transaction_start_date &lt; DATEADD(month,-10,getdate()) will this work instead of now() - 10 * interval &#39;1 month&#39;"
3104,really great walkthroughs Nate! love StrataScratch! it&#39;s really helped me a lot
3105,Respectfully asking for more SQL questions (especially for FB) on strata
3106,"Don&#39;t you mean MAANG?<br>Just kidding, thanks for the quality content Nate."
3107,Doesn&#39;t this fall under unfair graph representation ? The scales of both the graphs should be same when being compared.
3108,"Dear Nate, thank you for the wonderful video! I have one quick question. I generally tend to struggle with SQL interviews where interviewers ask to write queries on coderpad, without running them. Writing a complex query, end to end, without viewing the derived tables is a little challenging for me. Could you possibly suggest a way to overcome this? Your feedback would be of great help!"
3109,You are absolutely right. More SQL questions from FANG companies
3110,"Nate you are truly awesome, i was able to crack my SQL interview by watching your videos. Respect 🙏🏽"
3111,Uber DS interview is quite close to Facebook - more of product.
3112,Thank you for sharing your insights Nate. Very useful knowledge to utilize.
3113,You worked for FAANG nate as data scientist?
3114,Love your content and StrataScratch platform. It&#39;s helping in my interview preparation. :)
3115,This is youtube gold . . . Hats off Nate .
3116,"Hi Nate, Thank you for this great content.<br>I am trying to find an internship for summer 2022, Can you please tell me if there is any difference between a Data Science internship vs a Machine learning internship interviews?"
3117,Love your content Nate! Would it be possible for you to include SQL and Product sense questions from Snap Inc?
3118,Great work. StrataScratch is great for SQL and non-coding questions.
3119,👍👍👍👍👍
3120,Hey Nate! Great video! How much time do you expect to get this finish if this is a project at work?
3121,"Hi Nate, Thanks for the great videos. Won&#39;t it be simpler to insert it as a part of 1st for loop; instead of creating a df and then iterating through once again. Would like to know your thoughts."
3122,"Hi Nate, thank you for this video super useful was scanning through the internet for such a solution but could not find it. I am thinking what if there are many columns (e.g. 100 columns) wouldnt it be inefficient to type in row[&#39;column1], ..., row[&#39;column100]. ISsthere a way we can put the column information in a tuple, list or dictionary and passing through all this, like after SET also or vars_to_update.<br>another issue is where the excel column names have space (different from SQL columns) how do I then write the code as I keep having sytnax errors<br>Lastly, in the real world sometimes the excel files do not follow the template we stipulated, how should I design a validation check that is useful?"
3123,"Nice vid, I actually learned new things! One question, what&#39;s the point on creating a temporary DF for the new videos and then UPDATE them on a new for lopp. Can&#39;t we just UPDATE and INSERT the values in the same for loop?"
3124,Great video! Thank you! But question:<br>How do i get access to the Amazon RDS free databases? I created an account on aws but can&#39;t find any database-yt.
3125,"Hey Nate! Great video! I have a few feedback. First, the videos are very helpful and you should definitely continue doing more videos like this. Here are some ideas: How to schedule scripts to run on AWS; create tables, analyze data, and create a dashboard. Second, the playlist that includes this video is unordered. It is not hard to figure out which video should be watched first, but it doesn&#39;t hurt to sort it in the order that you want videos to be watched. Third, AWS doesn&#39;t include PostgreSQL in the free tier (at least anymore). Just a heads up. Keep up the good work!"
3126,"Nice video. But writing sql directly gets messy to maintain, why not use something like Sqlalchemy to separate your python code from the having to worry about the specific details of the specific  sql implementation and make it independent of the type of database manager used?"
3127,"Great video! One question, what ML implementation would you do with that data? I&#39;m trying to come up with something, but no success so far."
3128,There&#39;s really no rhyme or reason in the universe. This channel and these tutorials are gold but instead I am bombarded by ML channels playing with toy datasets and brand themselves as all you need clickbaits. You Sir are a saint.
3129,"Hi, Thank you for the video. I have a question: How would you go around  if you wanted to update your database in real time without you manually running the code. Perhaps we could design the code such that it is triggered when something changes in the source data  to insert or update data automatically in real-time(perhaps with some delay, of course)"
3130,Great video Nate! You really have the spirit for teaching. The vocabulary and content is easy to understand and follow. I hope Strata Scratch has a continued exponential growth.
3131,"Thanks Nath for your video on Pandas. I will apply this to my project. in python. Thanks,"
3132,"Do you have any solution for this error<br>psycopg2.errors.CharacterNotInRepertoire: invalid byte sequence for encoding &quot;UTF8&quot;: 0x00<br>CONTEXT:  COPY reviews, line 155393"
3133,Hi!!! nice video. I have a problem with the code. the error message is:  (could not connect to server: Connection timed out Is the server running on host &quot;nameofhost&quot; (107.20.xx.xx) and accepting 	TCP/IP connections on port 5432?).<br> How I fix this problem??. thanks for answers
3134,"Hi Nate! Really appreciate your content, its relevance and quality. So much to learn with each video! I wanted to ask why you opted for postgreSQL specifically? Can I use MS SQL server too?"
3135,"Hey Nate, your videos are just too good. I love how your channel is so dedicated towards real word data science. By the way I noticed that you started a video series, &quot;For your Data Science Project&quot; and I really want you to continue making videos for this particular series because there&#39;s literally no one on YouTube with such guidance on DS projects and I have been looking for one since a very long time because I have my placements just after 12 months and I really want to make a full stack data science project. Thank you."
3136,please make more video of this series and pipelines
3137,How the hell  this channel isn&#39;t more popular?
3138,"Brother, never miss one video. this is pure gold!! keeo doing this please, can i connect with u in linked in? <br>thanks bro, ure the best"
3139,much awaited video by myself...thanks for your time and effort Nate
3140,I don&#39;t get the &quot;with&quot; at the beginning. Too bad you never explained it.
3141,we can use lag function instead
3142,"Hey, just found out about your channel, been going through videos almost all day and wanted to give my thanks! The content is amazing."
3143,"Hi Nate, I think there&#39;s one thing wrong about this query. What if for a month there are 0 new users? By doing an inner join you&#39;re missing out on that logic.<br><br>In my opinion, the right way to do it is doing a left join between all users and new users and then assign a 0 wherever there&#39;s a null(in new users table).<br><br>Let me know what you think."
3144,"Hi Nate, In the problem statement it says  ratio of new users to &quot;existing users&quot;. I was wondering whether we should exclude the new users from all users and then get the existing users?? Thanks"
3145,You really share great content to learn advanced SQL. I thank you for that.<br>In this query why did you use Inner Join instead of Left Join?<br>How did you know that we have same months for both new abd existing users. Please explain to make it clear for me
3146,Impressive.<br>The people who work with you and especially the team you lead are certainly very lucky.
3147,Videos are great. Thanks.
3148,"You dont need the count(distinct user_id) at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtbMCAVXDmU&amp;t=9m47s"">9:47</a>. you did a min in your inner query which keeps once instance of that column per user_id. you said a user could show up multiple times in the same month but the min takes care of that"
3149,"I have been doing similar task at work utilising my colleagues shorter approach. In cte I count new user date, then in the main query I calculate shares like this: sum(iif(new user date&gt;=month,1,0))/count(user_id), and group by month. Less subqueries, would it be quicker as well? And thanks for great videos, looking forward to solving many problems with window functions you taught."
3150,Why we need to use distinct user_id ?? When we already have filtered out the data in subquery and did a group by on user_id and fetched the min(time_id).<br>So even if user would be having multiple entries in the same month but will result only one row when we did min(time_id)
3151,“New users are defined as users who started using services in the current month.” But where are we checking that condition? Your solution checks min value of the time_id column. As per my understanding the current month should the month in which we exceute the query. Could you please explain.
3152,Awesome loved the video🎉🎉
3153,"i love your videos narrating your mind map of creating queries, which is very helpful for sql learners!"
3154,great video! I&#39;ve learned a lot through your videos!! Thanks. Please keep posting this kind of videos
3155,good video. only catch is that you don&#39;t need the &#39;distinct&#39; keyword in the first CTE because it&#39;s already grouped by user_id and user_id will always be distinct in that case
3156,Your videos are helpful. Insights on how to break a problem statement are very detailed.
3157,"Hello Nate, quiet good video, just wanted to know that the question you share, are these type of question useful for a Data Engineer Sql rounds as well?"
3158,Just came across your videos and I really like your explanations! I was checking out StrataScratch and was wondering how the difficulty level maps to the difficulty level in Leetcode Database. Are your “Hard” questions harder than Leetcode “Hard”?
3159,@Nate Could you please post some more data science or data engineer SQL questions?
3160,This method only provides you with the channel&#39;s most recent 50 videos..... Does anyone know how to obtain all the videos of a channel?<br><br><br>Edit: NVM you use PageTokens.... Should have read your link. Thanks for the excellent tutorial Nate! Cannot believe you can now learn this stuff for FREE!
3161,Incredible how concisely this whole topic can be presented. Happy to very soon become a StrataScratch subscriber.
3162,"this video-storyboard on point. very clear, explain the scope and summarize. thank you!"
3163,FANTASTIC tutorial!! What can possibly top this?
3164,Brilliant! Great explanation of the process.
3165,This is definitely the best youtube API video I&#39;ve been able to find.  Thank you so much.  I actually went through two other videos before this and this one was the clearest that actually moved into a full pandas dataframe.  Thanks!
3166,"I&#39;m getting &quot;SyntaxWarning: list indices must be integers or slices, not str; perhaps you missed a comma?&quot; when I try to run the first for loop. Any ideas why? From what I can tell, the code is identical to yours.<br><br>Amazing video and series by the way, very excited"
3167,"so after collecting data from that API, say you uploaded a new video, how to write code to update data in the database with data of the new video automatically?"
3168,Awesome!!! TQVM!!
3169,Well done. Nice video.
3170,"Hi Nate, thank you for this great video! Just a quick tip, if any wants to grab the video data for multiple channel IDs at once you can directly use this method (from Youtube API doc): request = youtube.channels().list(<br>                part=&#39;snippet,contentDetails,statistics&#39;,<br>                id=&#39;,&#39;.join(channel_ids))<br>    response = request.execute()  <br>where channel_ids is a list of channel ids (e.g [&#39;id_1&#39;, &#39;id_2&#39;, &#39;id_3&#39;&#39;] <br>and youtube = build(&#39;youtube&#39;, &#39;v3&#39;, developerKey=api_key)"
3171,Love this tutorial!!
3172,"I cannot comprehend right words to express how great this video is and all the content that you create.<br>For all those who dream, plan or wish to make great career in data science you are simply an angel.<br><br>The most important part which I want to request is a complete playlist of all the components that you mentioned in the : &quot;The one and only one  Data Science Project you need&quot;.<br><br>This video covers the data collection part through API...and if other components are covered and all together that playlist would become the gold mine for aspirants.<br><br>I hope you get time from your busy schedule to consider my humble request...<br><br><br>Thanks a lot for all your videos which keep enlightening the Data Science  aspirants.🙏"
3173,i really like your content a lottt can you make more SQL and Databases vides (More Advanced) please and keep going
3174,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fklHBWow8vE&amp;t=6m11s"">6:11</a> that&#39;s basically why data engineers are needed"
3175,"Good old days, you can see dislike_count for any video. Great tutorial, many thanks!"
3176,I love your videos!
3177,You just gained a subscriber Bro 😃<br>Nice content
3178,"I forgot to thank you in April: awesome, thanks!"
3179,"I am having problems when parsing the response variable.

3180,"Is there a video with this question solved using CTEs and temp tables? I&#39;ve just started SQL and for now it&#39;s not clear to me when to use subqueries, cte or temp tables. Would love to see the same problem solved in 3 ways. It will help with improving the logic as well"
3181,Thank you so much for your videos. I learned a lot 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
3182,Thank you!
3183,"Nate, thank you for these videos. Extremely helpful."
3184,"Gave it a crack before watching your solution and now I hate myself for solving it like this, wish you could just throw in a HAVING session_type = &#39;viewer&#39; in the first cte and mysql would know to select the session_type associated with the row of the MIN(session_start), but unfortunately that&#39;s not how it works so that&#39;s where the second cte comes from. I realized I should probably use a window function after I started to pursue my solution, but I wanted to see if I could do without one: <br><br>initial logic: <br>#1*Find min session_start grouped by user_id having a session_type of viewer saved as cte<br><br>#2*Use cte from 1* to join original table on user_id (this keeps only the users who had first session as a viewer) <br><br><br>WITH sq AS(<br>SELECT user_id , MIN(session_start) as first_session<br>FROM twitch_sessions<br>GROUP BY user_id<br>),<br><br>sq2 AS(<br>SELECT sq.user_id, sq.first_session, twitch_sessions.session_type<br>FROM sq<br>JOIN twitch_sessions ON twitch_sessions.user_id = sq.user_id AND twitch_sessions.session_start = sq.first_session<br>WHERE session_type = &#39;viewer&#39;<br>)<br><br><br>SELECT sq.user_id , COUNT(*) as num_of_sessions<br>FROM sq<br>JOIN twitch_sessions ON sq.user_id = twitch_sessions.user_id<br>WHERE twitch_sessions.session_type = &#39;streamer&#39;<br>GROUP BY sq.user_id<br>ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC , user_id ASC;<br><br>If anyone knows a clever way to do get the session_type associated with the min(session_start) without a second cte or a window function I&#39;d love to hear it. Great content Nate."
3185,Can you recommend any platform to practice such example?
3186,I shared your youtube channel on my Facebook.  Your tutorials are great! Will share it also on my Linkedin.
3187,"Hey, I am digging your videos! I love the focus on particular companies SQL questions."
3188,Another level of optimization that could be applied to your query would be to use a &#39;WHERE EXISTS&#39; clause rather than &#39;USER_ID IN&#39;
3189,thanks
3190,Thanks for putting out all of this great content.
3191,Will there be a collection of SQL and Python questions asked in PayPal?
3192,You are awsome sir....Keep posting such a great sql videos....
3193,hope that i can get any technical interview test soon so that i can apply what i learn from you :)
3194,Thanks Nate! As always very clear explanation.
3195,👌👌👍
3196,Great!
3197,"Hey Nate, Your videos really helped me learning SQL...Can you make videos on how to use API for data and then saving it in some database as you told in one of your video that it is important part in data science process and it is widely used in professional data scientist projects?"
3198,Great video!
3199,"Hey Nat, by looking the question, i am not able to find where question is asking about the ratio..???"
3200,you are not allowed to explore the data
3201,This was really helpful! Thank you very much. Please do more such videos!
3202,"I wrote my code just before you explained your solution and the only thing I changed is I passed the step with doubling user_id checking, instead I counted them with distinct prefix &quot;count(distinct user_id)&quot;, everything else was the same (including nested select)."
3203,"Hi Nate,<br><br>Does the SQL implementation (Oracle, MySQL, PostgreSQL..) matters when interviewing with FB?<br><br>Which one would you recommend for FB particularly"
3204,"Hi Nate, I didn&#39;t get it why  you didn&#39;t select the distinct user during your code. as count(case when status=&#39;open&#39; then user_id else null)<br>if a user showed twice, it will be 2 for his count"
3205,Here&#39;s my solution:<br>select count(case when status = &#39;open&#39; then user_id else null end)*1.0/count(*)*1.0 as active_user_share<br>from fb_active_users<br>where country = &#39;USA&#39;
3206,Is casting the ratio as a float something that needs to be done only in certain SQL environments? The mysql editor on leetcode does produce a ratio when dividing an integer by another integer. Maybe this is because I used the round function though to go out 2 decimal places?
3207,How can I apply for a Data Base on facebook?.
3208,Solid thanks man
3209,Hi nate your vedios boost my confidence man Thanks a Lot
3210,Which portal you use for practise?
3211,Thanks a lot for that!
3212,"Hi Nate, awesome video! Your content is really helping me with my upcoming interview with Facebook. I was wondering, would it have been possible to just do a left join with two subqueries instead? Or are you just optimizing for runtime"
3213,"Hi Nate, thanks for the awesome videos. At <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRwxYOhHdE8&amp;t=7m13s"">7:13</a>,  I dont understand how count(NULL) will NOT count that particular row. I was going to use SUM(CASE(WHEN status = open, 0, 1)) but will a COUNT skip a row having a NULL value? thanks"
3214,I am afraid if in real interviews we can test parts of logic or carry out code increment? What do we do in that case?
3215,Hi Nate i just wanna say thanks for the videos! Your data science interview question with solutions are really helpful and engaging:)
3216,Great video!
3217,"Hey @ Nate, great video’s and thanks so much for the practical scenarios. I have been asked about Mapping in a data analysis interview and was told alot of mapping will be part ofthe job. Any videos on that any time soon ? Thanks"
3218,"Hi Nate, now I&#39;m beginning to practice the steps on solving the problem, not just go directly and dive to the coding. your steps is very logical and can be very advantageous in more complex question. Divide and conquer is the focus to come up with a logical solution. Thanks for continuous sharing your knowledge."
3219,"Very helpful, thank you"
3220,I learned sql through the sqlite &#39;flavor&#39; so I do understand what&#39;s going on. Is there a particular flavor that&#39;s popular in interviews?
3221,"With all of your videos, I click &#39;Like&#39; first and listen afterwards. And I am never disappointed :)"
3222,Is count(cas when x=&#39;y&#39; then 1 else null end) Equivalent as sum(cas when x=&#39;y&#39; then 1 else null end) ?
3223,Thanks Nate - very informative content.
3224,Is it just me or does data science have less and less to do with modeling each year?
3225,"You are really doing a great job, cleared most of my concepts."
3226,Thank You
3227,"So, I know all that SQL stuff, that doesn&#39;t make me a data science candidate does it? Surely there is more to it than that."
3228,"Great work sir, I finally found what I was looking for on your channel."
3229,Thank you!
3230,Super useful content Nate! Which of your previous videos would you recommend I watch/study for a SQL interview for a company like Square? I have my interview pretty soon and I haven’t found many tips/examples online about Square
3231,"Thank you Nate! Great content as usual, I really hope you keep going and I thank you alot."
3232,"This sounds like it works for everyone, not just a data scientiests :) Thank you for the video )"
3233,"Great video ! Besides, may I know how do I answer these set of questions in <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4Af2FcgamA&amp;t=7m27s"">7:27</a>, as I felt like most interviewers will ask these types of questions which I am currently not prepared for them atm"
3234,These information would be so useful for applying a job in DS. Thank you so much!
3235,"I had cleared 2 rounds for atleast 5 companies for a data scientist , some how I got left out. I feel they want something else that am not providing . <br>Coding --&gt; check <br>OOPS python --&gt; check<br>Traditional ML Algorithms --&gt; Check<br>DL and NLP algo and basic working including lib&#39;s like Spacy and TensorFlow --&gt; check<br>Docker --&gt; Check<br>Will try to add all the skills you mentioned in my bucket list. Will update the results once i get something"
3236,"I liked the bit where you go over some of the model-related questions we could be asked.  Maybe you could make a video that goes in more depth?  I actually got asked a question like this recently at a career-fair, and I was not ready for it.  I&#39;m still pretty inexperienced."
3237,Hi! Can you or any viewer suggest  a Project Topic that includes all points/steps mentioned in this video? 🙂<br><br>Thanks in Advance
3238,"i can´t find in the description the APIs examples you commented on the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4Af2FcgamA&amp;t=3m55s"">3:55</a> minute.  Where I can find it?"

3242,"Man, this video was just too good. There’re so many data science related videos tell ppl especially newbies how to become a data scientist. BUT this one is the most real and practical one. Thank you"
3243,Damn this video is way too good. Better than my Christmas gift. Thank you!
3244,"Excellent, thank you"
3245,Thanks for your great and timely suggestion.
3246,Awesome
3247,"HI! New suscriber, I love your channel! I have a question, can you give me some examples of a data science projects please ? I have been searching for a machine learning project for my final thesis project for a while and I am lost. THANK YOU"
3248,For me personally its very hard to get ideas for Data Science and Machine Learning Projects since every project I wanna do has already been solved by someone else on github so its nothing special and I don’t need to add it to my resume. What can I do?
3249,&quot;stay away from kaggle&quot; so what&#39;s your recommendations?
3250,I have been struggling with coming up with ideas for a meaningful and not a &quot;MNIST-type&quot; project for the last year and found it really hard to get inspired reading different works of others. This video though made it feel so intuitive and brought me an aha-moment. Thanks for the great work Nate.
3251,"I am a practicing analyst and from my experience each word he says is gold, thanks a lot friend needed to be reminded of this!"
3252,You are a star
3253,Is this only me understood &quot;last month&#39;s revenue&quot; as revenue for &quot;2019-12&quot;? Wouldn&#39;t it be better to call &quot;next month&#39;s revenue&quot;?
3254,"Thank you for the video!<br><br>What would happen if a particular month had no values? Then lag of 1 would not work... Self join on month and the calculated version of previous month, in a CTE could work... A month key = year*12 + month...prev month = month - 1"
3255,"Great content.. Keep it coming! If possible please reference differences in syntaxes across the different rdms.For me, the explanation of the double colon helped...as an example..  I use snowflake and terradata"
3256,"The way you explain is excellent, Nate. Keep it up, please. Thank you :)"
3257,"Thank you for putting this video explanation.<br><br>but When I searched for this question &quot;Monthly percentage difference stratascratch&quot;, youtube suggested me this video but I wasn&#39;t sure if this the exact one until I hit the question link from description.<br>Please change the title according to the question. Thank you."
3258,Amazing vid!!! Great going....Could you also the schema used in the creation of this problem?
3259,why not using partition by in the window function instead of group by?
3260,Thanks so much for sharing.   I’m new to this concept.  What was the window clause called?   And why was it at the end?   I was thinking of a cte which would be at beginning along with the with clause?    So this was something new for me.   Thanks again for your help.
3261,speechless! brilliant!
3262,"Hey Nate or anyone who has appeared for Amazon DS interviews, I have questions-<br>1) Do you think these questions are the part of initial round in Amazon interview? Do you think that the question may be hard/medium at this first one hour interview or are they more likely to be the part of interview further down the process?<br><br>2)Also I see that in Strata stat we get option of Python/PostgreSQL. Do you think that in the interviews these options are given to the candidate?"
3263,"How would this look like in SQL Server sql query:  <br><br>SELECT CONCAT(DATEPART(yy, created_at), ‘-‘, DATEPART(mm, created_at)) as year_month,  <br>((SUM(value) -  LAG(SUM( value), 1) OVER ( ORDER BY year_month))/ LAG(SUM( value), 1) OVER ( ORDER BY year_month))*100<br>       FROM sf_transactions)<br>GROUP BY year_month<br>ORDER BY year_month"
3264,Nate! Your efforts are much appreciated 👍<br>Thank you so much for uploading these helpful videos 🔥 You are the best teacher in SQL series. Love from India 😊
3265,"Hi Nate, can we not use PARTITION BY inside the window function instead of Group by ? Will that work? I will try and let you know if that works may be I will have to use a CTE"
3266,"Hi, Nate!<br><br>So, first of all, as always, impressive! Thank you for sharing.<br><br>But, I tried to solve it by myself before and, I couldn’t undertand why my code stoped working at this point, as below:<br><br><br>WITH t1 AS (SELECT<br>                    to_date (to_char(created_at :: date ,&#39;YYYY-MM&#39;), &#39;YYYY-MM-01&#39;) AS month_year,<br>                    SUM(value) AS tt_value<br>                FROM sf_transactions<br>                GROUP BY 1<br>                ORDER BY 1)<br><br>SELECT<br>    month_year,<br>    tt_value,<br>    LEAD (tt_value, 1, 0) OVER (ORDER BY month_year ASC) AS val_2<br>FROM t1<br><br><br><br>Could you help me? I reviewed it several times, but I couldn’t find my mistake.<br><br>Regardless, I understood that, in this case, lag is more apropriate than lead..."
3267,"Quick question! Based on the SQL query execution sequence rule, shouldn&#39;&#39;t we use the full query, to_char(created at::date, &#39;YYYY-MM&#39;, instead of year month next to GROUP BY?"
3268,very well explained... do you think this is a medium level interview question or hard level?
3269,What a great insight into the solution besides the solution itself.
3270,"Hey man  that&#39;s great video, beginning with this, can you recommend sites and also tools to practice topics T-SQL, really i appreciate it, thank you so much."
3271,"This content is absolutely underrated, why didn&#39;t I find you sooner :&lt; Pls do more topics on SQL"
3272,"‘extract’ is not a recognized built-in function name. ??? MSSQL<br>I used datepart(year, ‘datefield’)  instead."
3273,thanks！
3274,Do you have video on Date Manipulations in Excel ?
3275,"I appreciate your content a lot! I&#39;ve watched quite a few of your videos, and I&#39;m grateful for your willingness to help others learn. Now, curious as to why you cover mainly SQL and not Python(not complaining though, as a BI, I use SQL, not Python)<br>Also, would like to see more on APIs and data streams on your channel(how data is collected via APIs, and anything you consider relevant to this topic). Still new to this, but I&#39;m using it at work and would like to get a better understanding( I have a background in math, so SQL wasn&#39;t complicated to learn, as I had already covered set theory); the whole API thing seems a bit challenging to understand."
3276,"Nate, I&#39;ve been enjoying your content brother👌"
3277,I get confidence when I listed to your explanations. Thank you..
3278,Am glad i subcribed. You are amazing Nate. I had SQL experience and haven&#39;t used it for long time.  It is great to have a refresher. Real one
3279,Blessings mate. Wonderful video
3280,So before going through your solution I tried the question and I did not have to cast the column to date datatype and I just used extract and it gave me output. And even when I tried to filter for 2015 year with extract it still worked.  But overall great tip. I have always found it difficult to deal with dates in python or even in SQL. No less than a nightmare to be honest..
3281,"Here&#39;s my solution:<br>select inspection_year, count(*)<br>from <br>(<br>    select EXTRACT(YEAR FROM inspection_date) as inspection_year<br>    from sf_restaurant_health_violations<br>    where business_name ilike &#39;%Roxanne Cafe%&#39; and <br>    violation_id is not null<br>)a<br>group by inspection_year<br>order by inspection_year"
3282,man you rock ! thank you
3283,"Hey Nate, Why no just use &#39;WHERE year = 2015&#39;? Why can you use &#39;GROUP BY(year)&#39; but not &#39;WHERE year = 2015&#39;?"
3284,Really love this channel!!! Its so important for DA to pull the data out!!
3285,"Wow, you handled that sample question effortlessly. I&#39;m learning SQL foundations right now and have added the CAST function to my notes in case I have to do it in a SQL dialect that doesn&#39;t have the &#39;::&#39; function"
3286,thks a lot
3287,"I am confused, how Alias was available in group by???"
3288,Very useful! Thank you! Your channel helped me a lot!
3289,Keep doing these contents mate! You are the best
3290,Thanks for the explanation! What if I need to compare dates of year month like &quot;YYYY-MM&quot; and how can I do that after extracting that component?
3291,"I work as a data analyst and use SQL server in my job routine. I&#39;ve watched your few videos. Those are fantastic, However O could not find any detailed video on a single topic. Like SQL data types are very important while extracting data from data bases. Object change type is equally important. Would appreciate if you make a couple of detailed videos on aforementioned topics and also all important types of SQL value formats, like decimal comma formats,<br>Looking forward to them!!<br>Thank you!"
3292,Really liked the video. Could you make another video covering how one should navigate Kaggle as a beginner and explain the code from people who score high in popular competitions. Thanks
3293,I have a job so I can&#39;t make a perfect schedule. Could you give me some advise?
3294,I wish I could come across your channel much earlier. Thank you.
3295,This channel deserves more like and subscribe! Great content Nate!

In this specific instance, it is &quot;produce management principles&quot; when you mean &quot;product management principles&quot;."
3302,I have high respect for people like you who are so generous in sharing knowledge in this field of Data Science. Thank you so much.
3303,"Thanks for your guidance. May I ask, based on your experience in the industry now, how prevalent is the use of AutoML ?"
3304,Is udemy a good sources? I was thinking doing their class.
3305,Thanks alot. Do you think being a DBA for about 3 years can translate in to a softer landing for anything beside SQL? Been looking around for a while on how to approach Data Science and your video really helped me.

3317,I have learned a lot from you. I am trying to use your framework to in my following interviews.
3318,Honestly very great articulation - this is such a great resource for understanding sql and building the framework for the code. Thank you Nate.
3319,"Nate this is a really helpful video, as are all of these where you work through a real problem.   As someone wanting to become a data analyst, I’m wondering how in-depth my SQL interview questions are likely to be, vs those for a data science position.   Any idea?"
3320,Man this channel should be given a Nobel prize

I was giving a problem to solve, but was only given 2 columns for each table and no join was possible from this… but was all asked to give total sales of 2020 but wasn’t giving the column name for this…. Also they put Periods in the column names… eg. sales.order so I know I need to write it like [sales.order] as sales_order, it’s interesting. Also there is no data base to query from, I have to write the code blind in a txt file…."

3336,Wow so good
3337,Im new to your channel and so happy I ve found it; quite rare to find real world queries clearly explained beginning to end. I&#39;m writing similarly long queries at work(I m a BI) and it was a bit scary at the beginning. <br>I m curious what are some advanced SQL concepts in data science? <br>Thank you for the great content!
3338,Thanks Nate! An idea for the follow-up video: how would you refactor this code into smth more &#39;production-grade&#39; ?
3339,"Thanks for making these videos, you are awesome. Like you explained it is really hard to find these tips specially in SQL and though process  on solving problems.  Usually we only find basic syntax / or anything related to what is joins are  , what is rank or sql . Which we never get asked in interview."
3340,"Hey, really helpful explanation, Can we also do a OFFSET along with LIMIT to get 3rd highest issue?"
3341,"Hi, is it possible to replace the where Ilike by case when ilike here to use count ? if yes how would it be, and would it be more efficient or no ? :D"
3342,This approach is very helpful -- thanks for documenting how you solve these types of SQL problems!
3343,"Great, Thank you very much. this way of making each solution for each step relates most to how i process a problem.. Great explanation."

3352,Hi Nate. Can&#39;t we use where clause instead of group by and having in last step
3353,You are amazing Nate. Your videos are really insightful. God bless ya :)
3354,"Thanks for posting these great videos! I have a quick question. Why do we need to add GROUP BY <a href=""http://t.date/"">t.date</a> t.paying and t.nonn_paying in the end? Thanks!"
3355,"Amazing!<br>Thank you, Nate!"
3356,Why we need subquery? Can we just use HAVING statement right after the GROUP BY statement? (sort by ascending date is default also.)
3357,Excellent
3358,Thanks Nate for a good solution overview and just a quick query was ORDER BY Date necessary in the subquery or we can avoid it?

3449,"bro, how to start with an (almost) empty CLASS with the headers of your data file?"
3450,"This is absolutely amazing, Nathan. Can&#39;t thank you enough for sharing your talent in teaching across the community of DS. Would there be a &quot;quick&quot; way to change this code to open .xls instead of .csv? And if possible transform that .xls into a .csv file and proceed with the rest of your code? That would be super helpful if you have any advise (or other videos to refer to). Thanks!"

3452,what do you mean by running the os system and executing on the batch command? How do I do this because my files have not moved to the new datasets folder? Thank you!
3453,"Hi nate,nice video :)<br>I have a questions... How I fix this?? COPY from stdin failed: error in .read() call: UnicodeDecodeError &#39;charmap&#39; codec can&#39;t decode byte 0x81 in position 885: character maps to &lt;undefined&gt;<br>CONTEXT:  COPY tags, line 9260"

3455,"Hey Nate, your videos are just too good. I love how your channel is so dedicated towards real word data science. By the way I noticed that you started a video series, &quot;For your Data Science Project&quot; and I really want you to continue making videos for this particular series because there&#39;s literally no one on YouTube with such guidance on DS projects and I have been looking for one since a very long time because I have my placements just after 12 months and I really want to make a full stack data science project. Thank you."
3456,Simply Superb... love the way you explain and make it sound so simple. Thank you so much!!
3457,"Hi I love your videos, is it possible to make this script a rest API?"
3458,Thanks a lot. It&#39;s just what I was looking for to learn-how.<br>Just a though: wouldn&#39;t it be right/appropriate to clean the data in .csv and then move it to db?
3459,dude why use copy instead of insert into sql???
3460,This is incredible my friend. Can you do a video where you load each of the 3 files into separate tables? I&#39;d be curious to see how you dynamically handle that. Thanks for the great work.
3461,"What an amazing code !! , i love your explanation , just if you can give us the github link to the data so we can practice , Thank you"
3462,this is an incredible channel - thanks a ton man
3463,Love you teaching style.
3464,Awesome... Looking for a while for such code. Thanks for sharing it
3465,"Excellent work sir - you are making python so easy,great job and I respect for your work."

3469,the explanation is as easy as it gets &lt;3
3470,Why didnt you use group by?
3471,I think the hard part is understanding the data and what they mean by total customer spend. If someone misreads this part it would be difficult.

3482,Why PARTITION BY instead of GROUP BY?

Few suggestions:  <br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqBFgaMgFQA&amp;t=6m58s"">6:58</a>  It is more clear to use a variable name like &quot;file_name&quot; rather than the more ambiguous variable name &quot;file&quot;<br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqBFgaMgFQA&amp;t=8m31s"">8:31</a>  To improve readability, consider putting each .replace() call on a separate line followed by the escape character.

3517,Your question selection is quite good..!! Keep going..!! I have a suggestion though...To keep the whole thing interesting you can maybe give a similar question as take-home question and answer it in the next video..! What say..? Good work..!!👏👏
3518,"Great solution,  without your explanation, it is hard to figure it out. Thank you."
3519,Great video and content! I was able to use count(user2) OVER (Partition by user1) after doing the union to get to the friends of the users. <br>Was able to confirm by submitting on the platform too :)
3520,This was uniquely tough to think through.
3521,"I found this platform is very helpful because it allows me to run code and let me see result step by step. In this way, I can better understand what I&#39;m doing and where I got wrong."

3524,"Hey Nate , I must over-simplify it. Why I cannot use a sub query to calculate total user and window function to calculate friends per user.<br>Select user1, (select count(distinct user2) from xx) as totalususer, count(distinct user2 ) over (partition by user1) from …"
3525,"u can simply use something like this:<br>select a.* , a.i/(sum(a.i) over()) as aasd<br>from (<br><br>select requester_id as id, count(accepter_id ) as i from request_accepted<br>group by 1<br><br>union<br>select accepter_id  as id , count(requester_id) as i from request_accepted<br><br>group by 1<br>) a<br><br>order by 3 desc"
3526,Excellent!
3527,"That&#39;s insightful. Using a CTE helped me shorten the query. Also when using UNION, you get rid of duplicates with the individual tables as well.

3535,"Thanks Nate for keeping us educated !

3538,"I got confused with Invalid confirmation.

How to avoid this trap! Mostly happens for many Facebook questions."
3539,"Nate,<br><br>Why would you not include &quot;confirmation&quot; message type?  It seems like those are exactly the ones we&#39;re interested in.  Confirmation is the first step, the second step is for the user to confirm the confirmation.  Calculate the percentage where the confirmation is confirmed.<br><br>The other types of communication (&quot;message&quot; and &quot;friend request&quot;) would be something like &quot;you have a friend request&quot; or &quot;Janie posted on your wall&quot; and should be filtered out."

3541,Problem like this always needs a long time to understand the meaning. Even though it is not hard at all
3542,why did you filter out freind_request? shouldnt that be part of &quot;total texts&quot; sent on that day? Its a small thing but just curious.

3554,"Hi, is it okay to assume project title is unique? would it be better to use group by project_id?"
3555,Hi Nate I believe joining two tables does not exclude projects with 0 employees. I think you still need to use &quot;where emp_id &lt;&gt;0&quot; condition. Correct me If I am wrong.

3559,Do Data Science interviews have a round of data structures and algorithms questions ?
3560,Statquest youtube channel covers a lot of math and DS topics
3561,Extremely helpful video..
3562,The platform looks pretty good. Please add content for Data Engineering Interviews. A lot probably overlaps with Data Science anyway.
3563,They usually dont ask ask about technical things. What is more important is chemistry and that u connect with the recruiter. They hire the one they like. Skills can be taught later.
3564,Domain knowledge
3565,"Thank you. I am an aspiring computer scientist and therefore value the coding and mathematics exercises most, and some of these certainly help."
3566,"I prefer using a sub-query with a MAX window function. Also, you output more than the business_name and review_text that were asked.<br><br>thanks!"

3708,Russians when does not recognize the sovereignty of Britain over Liverpool and Manchester! British Defense Minister: Oh Mr. Shoigu punish me I was a bad boy
3709,"<a href=""https://youtu.be/61vJBn8T7E0"">https://youtu.be/61vJBn8T7E0</a> 👈 russia vs Ukraine"
3710,Let the war begains ❤️....I am with Russia...from india....
3711,"After Russian troops leave drills in Belarus on 20th of February, will NATO withdraw their troops from Russian border? I guess no"
3712,"What high ground does the UK and US think it has to try and negotiate with Russia about Ukraine?, NATO imperialism is the only reason. Britain has no horse in this race and each moment spent on this farce is more time wasted not tackling the cost of living crisis, hospital waiting lists or the collapse of the Stormont government."
3713,He got two faces
3714,"According to V.Putin, everyone should submit to Russia, because if the big powers will resist its conquest of the West, &quot;there will be no winners&quot;. Is it not a fear-mongering and a psychological attack on Europe and on the West in general?"
3715,"Hey bbc, you people really have a lot of time to waste or you like doing that.can this helpless poor creature Mr Russian ambassador take you any where in this <a href=""http://situation.how/"">situation.how</a> much he is aware of mas&quot;cow&#39;s&quot; actual plans.What you are trying to find through this <a href=""http://interview.you/"">interview.you</a> won&#39;t find anything because he knows nothing.he looks confused and frightened.your well prepared smart questions will not help at all.<br>By the way if you people offer him for asylum, he.might avail 😁.<br>Actually what I think, communists or kabal has made wrong move by bringing Russian troops on Ukrainian border, so let them eat and drink and pie and poop there in this harsh winter and after sometime they will go back.kabal has totally miscalculated the scenario.Actually they are disturbed by NATO expansion.all their hard work to derail Christians from religion and bringing horrible things like gey and lesbian cultures and sex freedom and countless other evils in to Christian societies is failing.they almost have failed in Muslim countries but they have managed to destroy many Muslim countries through wars.Christianity is waking up and this is &quot;main pain&quot; in their <a href=""http://buds.nato/"">buds.NATO</a> expansion is most undesired thing for them.<br>Stay strong people and believe you me these jerks are not able to cause any harm.they are very smart in lies and frauds.when they are exposed, they are just poor nasty and dirty coyotes."
3716,"I don’t like this journalist, it’s like he’s not after the truth, just want to catch him and twist his words"
3717,"Looks like a very affable, happy go lucky chap. I guess everything is fine again, we can dust ourselves off and start kicking the sand bag down the road again."
3718,"Russia seems to admit to no foolish designs to invade Ukraine, Estonia or Poland.<br>The US effort to promote a picture of Putin with horns grows more evident daily......<br>The image of Russian aggression the US State Department presents,<br>is illustrated to the world by the Boy Who Cried Wolf,<br>one too many times?<br>The lies that the US has presented in the interest of profits,<br>seems to color their rhetoric with some green paint,<br>that indicates envy?<br>US Investors desires to drive Russia from a multi billion dollar<br>fuel business in Europe, grow more easy to define every day.....<br>The Yellow Cake Bake sales on the lawn of the White House,<br>actually emphasize the effort......"
3719,"Minsk agreements as said, are the effort to have peace and solutions, and seems the reason that they need more work, uk diplomate was very young, and Boris had problems in uk. Not a divided ukraine, a ukraine with communes in regions, like in other big countries."
3720,I don&#39;t think that Russia ever intended to invade the Ukraine. This is just a strategic chess move by Russia to negotiate a settlement in which NATO will not place missiles at their front door in the Ukraine. If Russia intended to invade the Ukraine they would have simply rushed across the border like Hitler did in his Blitzkrieg attacks at the start of World War II. Russia knows that massing troops at the border with the Ukraine would totally destroy the element of surprise if they were serious about invading the Ukraine.
3721,He was a scientist until 2008.<br>Aster …. ?? Just crap
3722,"Rest In Peace, sir. And thank you."

3730,"He was the sole discoverer of the h.i.v. virus. Wow, why does this kind of medical video bring out all the superstitious and willfully ignorant?"
3731,"Well, he was right. It was made in a lab."
3732,Rest in peace Luc and thank you for everything
3733,"Oh my GOD, ..This honest soul stolen from life, by the evil of demons involved with AIDS EPIDEMIC THAT HAS BEEN PUSHED ACROSS CANADA, AND USA BY THE PROPAGANDA PUSHING MEDIA CONGLOMERATES. JUST PLAIN EVIL, HE FOUND OUT PROOF, AND THEY KILLED HIM."
3734,The discoverer of HIV dies of Covid.
3735,He is not wrong covid 19 was made in a lab do you think is coincidence that the virus started in a city that contains a virology lab and the government of china didn&#39;t let anyone investigate.
3736,Covid 19 most likely was made in a lab
3737,Defund the BBC
3738,Rest in pis
3739,"RIP.  Like the deaths of Brandy Vaughan and Kerry Mullis, convenient for some people."
3740,Least less chance of catching Chlamydia
3741,"why forest fires, bbc?"
3742,According to a documentary series &quot;Australia in Colour&quot; Koalas were hunted to provide fur for the fashion industry
3743,"Chinese,living in Australia, eating koalas. <br>New, black death will announce then.🤣"
3744,It&#39;s called burning to death and then starving
3745,Awwww cutie pie 🥰
3746,The koala is gonna become Australia&#39;s Panda. Two useless animals too dumb to survive without human intervention
3747,Ohh nooo! Those dang fires played a huge part of this!! Thank goodness that there are a bunch of specimens in captivity at the moment so we can potentially repopulate the species with supplemental animals.
3748,ESPAÑA EN PIE.<br>TREMENDO EXITO DE VOX EN VALLADOLID.<br>FIN.<br>GRACIAS.
3749,"why forest fires, bbc?"
3750,Rib eye koala...sizzling
3751,We love Koala BBQ.
3752,Botts carry sentiual dialect
3753,"why forest fires, bbc?"
3754,A bot replied to two bots below. Glitches I guess
3755,Tank you  for  are  information
3756,"If only the fine people of Australia would just stop hunting the Koalas for its meat, I&#39;m sure they will bounce back. The dingo may still be around if that species weren&#39;t hunted (mostly hunted and eaten as puppies only hours old) to it&#39;s end."
3757,"Ok, <b>but,</b> and here me out here, let the population get low enough, but not too low, to wipe out Koala Clamydia, but keep it still high enough to bounce back first. Think about it, they&#39;re herbivores, right? And captive bred, while not super happy, helps population growth. Look at those things, and tell me you don&#39;t want one? Why wouldn&#39;t you, they&#39;re adorable. But why don&#39;t people usually have em as pets? Clamydia. Remove that, which can be done easiest with a lower population, and bam. They become basically designer pets. I know there are a lot of ethical issues here, but bottom line it would work to bolster their population."
3758,Why are bots posting the same comments?
3759,Stand with Kamila
3760,Why the Swedish waited so long to analyze this probe ? Olso she give 2 test after 25.12.21 in which she is clean. Why now ?<br>I am asking as a bulgarian if someone ask why our gymnastic team is soo good.
3761,"Russians could win team figure skating competitions with An Shcherbakova, with Alex Trusov and many more. If Kamilla Valieva had just looked at doping at least once, the Russians would not have taken the risk and would not have put her up for competitions. This story looks silly. This provocation could not be properly prepared. Smart people will never believe it!"
3762,Russia has a cultural insecurity issue.
3763,"Timing of all this seems rather conspicuous. If I recall, figure skating was the only sport that the Russians didn’t employ PEDs when the doping scandal came to light in 2014. So for Russia to have the temerity to dope for a sport they have never previously, whilst under the microscope of a country wide Olympic ban looks out of character.<br><br>Seems more so like a clear message that western NATO countries are applying geopolitical pressure on Russia through intermediary channels given the backdrop of failed Ukraine-Russia diplomatic talks."
3764,At what point is Russia held responsible? Im not talking &quot;ROC&quot; type punishment but Im talking entire skating programs banned or the entire country not allowed to participate  <br><br>Their continued &amp; egregious doping violations are a slap in the face to those athletes who train all their lives to do it the right way.<br><br>Ban Russia entirely for 20 years: 5 cycles of games. And watch every athlete eyeball eachother to make sure they are all clean  from then on out
3765,"Let&#39;s be frank.  We all have known it for years, seeing  suddenly so many Russian skaters started to do so many  impossible jumps without hurting their joints.  But we couldn&#39;t get them because Russians were so skillful in dealing drugs."
3766,China&#39;s Sun Yang and Russia&#39;s Nadezhda Sergeeva also tested positive for trimetazidine and swift action was taken to ban and disqualify them. It wouldn&#39;t be fair if she were allowed to compete considering it&#39;s the same banned substance.
3767,"There is ZERO gray area in this matter! If the Olympic movement is going to be considered legitimate, she should be disqualified from the singles competition and Russia should be disqualified from the team competition and not receive a gold medal, PERIOD!!"
3768,Kamila … We are with you 🧡💛💙💜❤️💜💙🧡💛
3769,Why bring all of this up and not reveal what substance she specifically tested positive for?
3770,Poor BBC says the athlete isn&#39;t competing rather for Rassian Olympic Committee.<br>🤣🤣🤣<br>💚💛❤️
3771,Nobody care about the communist Olympics aka the genocide games
3772,bbc skating on gold
3773,I heard that the Italians forgot about WWII，But can&#39;t forget the 2002 World Cup in South Korea！ The 2002 World Cup in South Korea could be called the biggest shady match in world history
3774,"Its very impressive to see how western propaganda agains russia works , se did several other tests after that test and all of them was negative why they didn’t mention nothing about that? Why they dont say that Trimetazidine is the component that prevent symptoms of angina that usually old people used and it has 0 effect of sportive performance, explosiveness, resistance or any other parameters needed in that sport especially in such a miserable  dose that was relive and why the European lab that by the law must revel the results after one month do it straight after she took gold fir team competition , this is disgusting , sneaky ,villainous move by commissions agains pure artistic and atletiche talent in that sport that  never seen before ,all this political war do not cost a second of her natural beauty performance"
3775,is it a tonya harding case with tmz instead a baseball bat? a bit of tmz in the soup on 25.12 in st. petersburg? what if another trainer had interest to place his girl at the olympics? i follow kamila about 3 years now since she was 12 and she always stood out from the competition.
3776,Kamila is allowed to compete. This info is outdated.
3777,"Those are actual intrigues inside their team. There is huge competition among skaters and all of them are trained by the the same coach. the goal was to get the results before the Olympics, so she wouldn’t go at all, replaced by other girl. But Stockholm’s laboratory for some reason delayed the results of the doping probe. Valieva was going for the gold. Poor Girl(((("
3778,"Russia and China shouldn&#39;t participate or host the olympics ever. I get we let them do it out of sheer greed but China stole men&#39;s short track speed racing, and russia drugs these poor girls"
3779,this is outrageous. I&#39;ve never heard of anyone being forcibly hospitalized when they have family offering to care for them. unbelievable. how could that happen?

3786,"The way to bring about world peace. “Always treat others as you would like them to treat you.” And “Love your neighbour as yourself.” That is the Law and the Prophets.<br><br>Never worship and pray in the way of religions (not even in the way of Catholicism nor Christianity) because religions are all led by the many blind guides and false prophets of whom Jesus had already warned us to beware of, almost 2,000 years ago. They all make up their own laws and prayers. When he alone (in the name of Immanuel) is the anointed Son of Man and true Prophet sent by God, to be always our one Teacher and to set us free from all religions.<br><br>These are the words of the Lord God: <br>“I will raise up for them a prophet like you [Moses] from among their fellow Israelites, and I will put my words in his mouth.” – (at Deuteronomy 18: 18) –<br><br>“Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign: A young woman is with child, and she will bear a son, and will call him Immanuel.” [“God is with us”] – (The Prophet Isaiah 7: 14)<br><br>“If you have ears to hear, then hear.” – (Jesus in the name of Immanuel the Messiah, at Mark 4: 23) – <br><br>“God is spirit, and those who worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth.” – (at John 4: 24) –<br><br>“In truth I tell you, anyone who gives heed to what I say and puts his trust in him who sent me, has hold of eternal life and does not come up for judgement, but has already passed from death to life.” – (John 5: 24) –<br><br>“You shall know the truth, and the truth will set you free.” – (John 8: 32) –<br> <br>“When you pray, go into a room by yourself, and shut the door. Pray to your Father who is there in the secret place; and your Father who sees what is secret will reward you.<br>In your prayers do not go babbling on like the heathen, who imagine that the more they say the more likely they are to be heard.<br>Do not imitate them. Your Father knows what your needs are before you ask him.<br>This is how you should pray:<br>Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name,<br>Your kingdom come; your will be done, on earth as in heaven,<br>Give us today our daily bread,<br>Forgive us the wrong we have done, as we have forgiven those who have wronged us.<br>And do not bring us to the test, but save us from the evil one.<br>For yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory, for ever.<br>Amen.<br>For if you forgive others the wrongs they have done, your heavenly Father will also forgive you; but if you do not forgive others, then the wrongs you have done will not be forgiven by your Father.” – (Matthew 6: 6-15) –<br><br>“Pass no judgement, and you will not be judged. For as you judge others, so you will yourselves be judged, and whatever measure you deal out to others will be dealt back to you.” – (Matthew 7: 1-2) –<br><br>“Truly I tell you; if anyone obeys my teaching he shall never know what it is to die.” – (John 8: 51) –<br><br>“Always treat others as you would like them to treat you: that is the Law and the Prophets.<br>Enter through the narrow gate. For wide is the gate and broad is the road that leads to destruction, and many enter through it. But small is the gate and narrow the road that leads to life and only a few find it.” (Matthew 7: 12-14) –<br><br>“I am the gate; anyone who comes into the fold through me shall be safe. He shall go in and out and shall find pasturage.<br>The thief comes only to steal, to kill, to destroy; I have come that men may have life, and may have it in all its fullness.” – (John 10: 9-10) –<br><br>“Beware of false prophets, men who come to you dressed up as sheep while underneath they are savage wolves. You will recognize them by the fruits they bear.” – (Matthew 7: 15-16) –<br><br>‘Why do you keep calling me “Lord, Lord,”—and never do what I tell you?’ – (Luke 6: 46) –<br>“I am the resurrection and I am life. If a man has faith in me, even though he dies, he shall come to life; and anyone who is alive and has faith shall never die.” – (John 11: 25-26) –<br><br>“I have not come to judge the world, but to save the world.” – (John 12: 47) –<br>“Whoever will acknowledge me before men, I will acknowledge him before my Father in heaven; and whoever disowns me before men, I will disown him before my Father in heaven.” – (Matthew 10: 32-34) –<br><br>“Any plant that is not of my heavenly Father’s planting will be rooted up. Leave them alone; they are blind guides, and if one blind man guides another they will both fall into the ditch.” – (Matthew 15: 13-14) –<br><br>“I am the way; I am the truth and I am life; no one comes to the Father except by me. If you knew me you would know my Father too.” – (John 14: 6-7) –<br><br>“The disciples came to Jesus and asked, ‘Who then is the greatest in the kingdom of Heaven?’ <br>He called a child, set him in front of them, and said, ‘I tell you this: unless you turn round and become like children, you will never enter the kingdom of Heaven. <br>Let a man humble himself till he is like this child, and he will be the greatest in the kingdom of Heaven. Whoever receives one such child in my name receives me. But if a man is a cause of stumbling to one of these little ones who have faith in me, it would be better for him to have a millstone hung round his neck and be drowned in the depths of the sea.<br>Alas for the world that such causes of stumbling arise! Come they must, but woe betide the man through who they come!’”  – (Matthew 18: 1-7) –<br><br>“Though many are called, few are chosen.” – (Matthew 22: 14) –<br><br>“An expert in the law, [a leading religious Pharisee] tested him with this question: ‘Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the Law?’ He answered, ‘Love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind. That is the greatest commandment. It comes first. The second is like it: Love your neighbour as yourself. Everything in the Law and the Prophets hangs on these two commandments.’” – (Matthew 22: 35-40) –<br><br>“Do not call any man on earth ‘father’; for you have one Father and he is in heaven. Nor must you be called ‘teacher’; you have one Teacher, the Messiah.” – (Matthew 23: 9-10) –<br><br>“There is no greater love than this, that a man should lay down his life for his friends.” – (John 15: 13) –<br><br>“Take care that no one misleads you: For many will come claiming my name…” – (Matthew 24: 4) – <br>“Many false prophets will arise, and will mislead many; and as lawlessness spreads, men’s love for one another will grow cold. But the man who holds out to the end will be saved. And this gospel of the Kingdom will be proclaimed throughout the earth as a testimony to all nations; and then the end will come.” – (Matthew 24: 11-14) –<br><br>&quot;Stay awake, and pray that you may be spared the test: The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.&quot; – (Matthew 26: 41) –<br>“However, when he comes who is the Spirit of truth; he will guide you into all the truth.” – (John 16: 13) –<br> <br>Yours always, in true Spirit and in our one given prayer, 2gointruth, on Friday the 11th of February 2022: – (Matthew 5: 14-16) – Where every minute (of both day and night) can be a new beginning for any one of us. Let it always be you. Pray to God often, in the way prescribed above, before it is too late."

3855,"Climate Crisis? I just read an article in the Washington Post about the end of the polar ice caps and how researchers sent an expedition to the arctic and couldn&#39;t find any ice. The article was written in 1922. If fusion physicists admit that they won&#39;t be able to create power with fusion before the &quot;end of the world&quot;, then why are they even bothering?"

3883,Petrol is high not bec of the lack of supply but bec there is too much supply. Oil  and gas industries didnt sell enough oil the past year due to the Covid situation and they have to make money in order to recover the money they spent for extraction and processing  of oil and gas. That&#39;s the real reason for the price increase.

3898,"Like so many extinction events, climate change may be the single most important factor. Neanderthals and humans were most likely able to exploit local resources in equal measure when the climate was colder but as the climate warmed, what were once incremental differences between the two groups became more significant. Yes, Neanderthals and humans interbred but it&#39;s also possible that the hunting methods used by Neanderthals became less effective as the fauna and environment changed."

3901,I keep wondering what will our world be like if Neanderthals or other Hominids didn&#39;t go extinct.
3902,Some have their dna now. So they did not die.
3903,"Research by  Gili Greenbaum of Stanford University showed that the immune systems of both species could not survive each other’s illnesses and the Neanderthal’s immune system ultimately lost out. This was published 3 years ago, if he’s such an expert he should know about this. Skills and organisation and all that can only develop if you live 😉 Also: don’t knock the Neanderthals, they had skills, they had organisation, they had culture, they had burial rituals... To this day we carry Neanderthal DNA."

3907,"Isn&#39;t it a bit suspicious that whatever date the archaeologists are currently accepting based on nothing but an absence of further evidence, it&#39;s taught as a near certainty; and the geneticists then step up and say, &#39;yep, based on our mysterious arcane lore that nobody can understand, the archeologists are spot on.  We&#39;re can confirm with 99% certainty.&#39;   ...  And then, and then...  the archeologists find more bones 12k years older...<br>   <br>   It reminds me of learning about the food pyramid as a kid, teaching all the school kids what foods they were supposed to eat, and it what proportions, and all based on the consensus expert opinion of scientific dieticians.  And then, one day, it was all wrong and turned upside down, and now carbs make you fat, and eating actual fat doesn&#39;t, supposedly.  I have no problem with progress.  We need more of that.  I have a problem with liars peddling whatever is the current best guess as fact, instead of <i>as</i> the current best guess. And as far as I can tell, that&#39;s all the sciences.  That&#39;s their bread and butter.  They don&#39;t know shit about shit, but it&#39;s their business model to go about pretending and insisting that they do.<br><br>   They do this always, in every generation, every era, despite scientific revolution after revolution after revolution.<br>   And yet, in every generation, the population buys, once again, that <i>this time,</i> they&#39;ve finally got it right, and we should believe them.  We are that programmed by evolution to suck the proverbial dick of self-appointed authorities.  I guess it&#39;s a survival mechanism.<br>   Well, I&#39;m noticing things in recent years that suggests to <i>me</i> that scientists are more full of shit than <i>ever before.</i>  What&#39;s happening in the sciences now isn&#39;t progress; it&#39;s regress.  They invested in some bullshit early on, which was a <i>moral</i> failing.  But nobody could admit it, so they&#39;ve been building ever more extravagant bullshit on top of it in a desperate struggle to keep their structures of theory commensurate with observable reality.  But much of what they preach now, as the clergy they have become, while commensurate if one jumps through enough hoops, has not been the <i>best hypothesis</i> for a long time.<br>   This seems to have happened across the board, to a significant degree, in all the sciences."

3934,Some of the old government top police and army commanders were really cruel to civilians and have killed many innocent people for various reasons. So it wouldn&#39;t be surprising to me if someone took revenge from them. And people assume it is taliban. Not denying that they weren&#39;t but it is more then likely that other people are also taking revenge. Its either this or people are making false statements to make a case in foreign countries to get asylum.
3935,"It is not a race problem.  It is a problem with evil in society.  There are many good doctors out there and unfortunately that means there are some bad ones too.  They profit on the suffering of others and extremely few would intentionally cause that suffering.<br><br>To solve the problem, entrance tests into medical school need to be even more stringent on the psychological profile and nature of the candidate.  But our dilemma is that we already have too few doctors in this world so making it harder to become doctors would mean even fewer doctors.  There needs to be a push in primary/secondary school education to encourage people to help others in need, by becoming doctors (and other professionals) if that is their calling."
3936,Then on the other hand if she went to an abortion clinic the BBC would be clapping loudly. Don&#39;t be fooled by the BBCs fluff stories they are deeply racist and against protecting the most vulnerable humans of all humans.
3937,It doesn&#39;t come to race. It comes to the fact that there&#39;s not enough support for early pregnancy nor support in finding out why we women miscarry. It also happened to me.
3938,I thank God that my two were born in a military hospital. I know for a fact that I was treated better because of my husband&#39;s rank. So many others were not so lucky.

3967,"when women and feminists from world  fights against burqa and hijab sexist oppression and slavery  on women<br>its sad to see in india radicalized groups are fighting against progression <br><br>This is not at all about hijab row, if so, there must have been huge protests in Kerala when govt and even Muslim educational centers Banned hijab face covering attire and niqab burqa, over in 150 institutes. Ironically back Then everyone praised it as a progressive move including activists and politicians. <br> <br>Just like the failed protest for CAA<br>Just like the failed protest for NRC <br>There is now another protest under the cover of Hijab row<br> <br> <br>Well, what’s happening in Karnataka right now is nothing but a clear political act. <br> <br>Educational institutes of Karnataka just like in any other state have a clear uniform code and circular “Every student must be equal under one uniform” In general. School uniform give students the sense of oneness that unites them together regardless of their class, caste, status, and religion. <br> <br> <br>When it comes to educational space religious affairs or symbolism must be free from them. <br>However, exceptions are allowed for religious requirements under Indian law along with strict school uniform codes, for instance having a turban or hijab (head covering only) that never violates school uniform or for the short period of time on festivals &amp; spiritual observations, but school uniform is and must be the priority throughout the year. <br> <br>Anyhow, the current issue escalated when 6-7 female students from Udupi district, Karnataka went to school in full burqa over school unfirm with hijab (as one can see it clearly from the viral video circulating) and demanding to allow them inside campus which violates the rules of educational institute and rightfully school management have blocked those students who does not comply with rules.<br> <br>When the demanding rose, students from other beliefs and culture staged their protest against the unwanted chaos at their campus which is biased and demanding unity in uniform. <br> <br>This was quickly picked up by every political parties across the nation and region and escalated into further chaos run by misinformation, false narratives and activism with a clear propaganda. <br> <br>The fact Hijab is considered as a “Medieval symbol of backwardness, disempowerment and patriarchy” By none other than B.R. Ambedkar who wrote Indian constitution in his book Pakistan or partition of India is to be noted. <br> <br>Also, the fact that burqa and hijab is sexist and are created as the part of racialization to oppress women and it stands as symbol of slavery. Women around the world are killed, tortured, raped, and attacked for not covering their body with burqa or Hijab. Despite this part time feminists are activists batting for backwardness is nothing but irony and doglapan in shark tank language. Family of Jordan prince Abdullah II direct decedent &amp; 41st generation of Prophet Muhammad have rejected Burqa and hijab in public stating it is not required or essential in Islam And no one knows better than them. <br> <br>On the basic of ongoing violence on Hijab Raw government have undertaken investigation and the findings are the matter of concern. Initially Local radical party named pfi/spdi have organized hijab day before the controversy started and they highly radicalized young students and argued them to attend schools with full Burqa &amp; Hijab. The first bunch of students who showed up with Burqa and hijab over school unfirm where used to attend the school with full uniform before and their social media clearly exposed them having a normal life without Burqa or hijab in public places. All of student demand for Hijab but wearing Burqa to school is questionable that no one care to ask. However, Destructive narratives and journalism are always good at giving emotional activism angel to gain common citizens attention and support. And the fact peoples blind hate against current government fuel the movement into another level. <br> <br>To conclude as a Sensible Indian, don’t carry out with the narratives and pseudo activism. Before taking a stand, look at the issue with neutral perspective and analyze. Uniform is for equality and unity. Expectation can be considered by not compromising the uniform. People can choose their outfits but when it comes to school, choice must be to be equal under one uniform that represent them as students."

Since Serbians will rightfully NEVER join the gang that bombarded us with depleted uranium during the &#39;90s, occupied Kosovo and Metochia and then condemned Serbs for the war that the CIA had planned against us long beforehand, GB is trying to reunite Bosnia that they had deliberately divided in the &#39;90s, this time in order to forcefully pull it into NATO, hoping that Croatians and Muslims would ease the process and overvote the Serbs, if the country were united again. Now, whoever knows a bit of history before the said bombardment, would understand that Serbs and Russians belong to the same culture, that Russians have migrated to Russia from the Vinca region, near Belgrade, during the neolithic era, that we had almost 2000 years of common Christian history, language, culture and justice systems stemming from The East Roman Empire, all of which you Westerners gladly disregard, in order to forget the truth of force, robbery and deliberate destruction of this part of the world in order to build your empires and decorate your Museums with stollen artifacts, hailed by the Vatican, Roman Club, Bilderberg, Soros, Rockefellers and the likes."

3993,I wish corona again strikes India to shut all of them in their house...
3994,BBC is full of Shit. BBC = Big Bull 💩
3995,I am indian muslim thanks BBC ❤️🙏
3996,Healthy debate? Barkha dutt is delusional. Hindus are oppressing Muslims in India
3997,Wear your school uniform no problem but what is the problem if Muslim women wear hijab it&#39;s just a head scarf and it is not interrupting the school uniform . I don&#39;t have a problem if hindu people wear their scarf on their head it is no such of a big problem .
3998,सिर्फ कर्नाटक में ही नहीं बल्कि पूरे देश में हिजाब विवाद बहुत तेजी से बढ़ रहा है.  इस पर जल्द से जल्द फैसला आना चाहिए नहीं तो विदेशी ताकतों को इस मामले का फायदा मिल सकता है।
3999,Modi and the current politicians are bigots.
4000,Modi&#39;s government is a scourge for India.
4001,"<a href=""https://youtu.be/_qV1J7POaG8"">https://youtu.be/_qV1J7POaG8</a><br>True colour of hijabis revealed,as who funded and why"

4003,this is the chance for Muslim woman freedom .so many women got beat up by their husband and father or brother and they have to cover their face to cover up. they want to stay that way fine .Muslim woman wants to be Freedom then they would help Indian government .
4004,"True freedom of worship is in Christianity, if i want i can dress like a Moslem, hindu, bhuda, jew, Samaritan, it doesn&#39;t matter coz my God Almighty is interested in the state of my HEART.🙏❤️🔥🍞🍷"

4009,"It&#39;s shouldn&#39;t happen but why are you giving importantance to Malala, she used the opportunity to grow herself."
4010,This issue is Very soon coming to UK too.
4011,Come on BBC <br>The BBC CANNOT have spelling errors in titles. Seriously the world is fucked up enough. <br>“Code” of living
4012,"It’s strange for me as a Norwegian that this is a new thing. Since 2000 we’ve had a de facto go to website/app for job listings, property, and selling and/or getting free items. It’s just weird that this is a news report from the US 22 years later about a platform people need that obviously doesn’t exist there."
4013,Care and share..... NFP
4014,"It sucks , because this is very true, especially in California. You barley get by, and it’s come to the point where I’m moving out of state. Everything is so expensive and I can see within these next few years there is going to be A LOT more homeless out here."
4015,I said that the BBC are living in the metaverce making up lies &quot;code of living&quot;
4016,This is why I only buy used clothing. It’s great for my wallet and the environment.
4017,"Typo in title, you mean COST of living crisis"

4020,"Wow, what a great idea."
4021,This needs to be more common. Leaving stuff outside can ruin the stuff. <br>But having one huge platform to give and find stuff would be incredible. Instead of wasting space and money with things like goodwill. Let&#39;s stop giving stuff away for people to have to go and buy. Instead of get something for free and simply need to go and pickup.
4022,"Look at the reality IM now dealing with,, others want to be able to force me to hear a the results of a constructed lie whilst they refuse to hear a genuine truth. need I say more??"
4023,BBC can&#39;t spell! LOL!

4029,You&#39;d be lucky to get your hands on them before the local second hand stores. Only to sell it again.
4030,"There is so much stuff that is still working and useful that gets trashed. Not only are &quot;buy nothing&quot; groups really good for people, they are really good for the planet."
4031,Ets:::: b/s ...money making b/s way 2 go ....yet eastern European
4032,This is why you dont talk to authorities. What did panarama think the home office would do. Give all the migrants  a refund and permenant right to remain.

4045,"not according to education / not because low paid job / not because a nutrients problem, there is only voices or a noises that are produced by a human. people need to rest , need a peach , need to focus, need energy we need to concentrate in our daily activities.... close the door we can learn it but to remove all the voices, it&#39;s harmful, it&#39;s cruel , it&#39;s everything that we need to deal with high patient to carry our own life among this problem."
